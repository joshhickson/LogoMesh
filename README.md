> *A recursive thought engine for humans and AI—designed to evolve meaning, resolve contradictions, and externalize self-reflection.*

LogoMesh is a local-first cognitive framework that enables users to create, organise, and navigate complex ideas through interconnected “thought bubbles,” nested segments, and flexible metadata filters. The application is built on a React front-end and a Node.js/Express back-end and stores data in SQLite by default. All processing occurs on the local machine unless the user explicitly installs a cloud-aware plug-in.

## Project Status

| Phase | Objective | High-level Deliverables | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------|--------|
| 0 | Framework Skeleton | React/Node scaffold, baseline tests | Complete |
| 1 | Core Functionality | Thought graph, JSON I/O, initial plug-in scaffold | Complete |
| **2** | Hardened Spine | Type-safe codebase, secure plug-in sandbox, TaskEngine, LLM gateway, observability | **In progress** |
| 2 b | Memory Layer | Vector store, summarisation and relevance routing, read-only FlowMesh CLI | Planned |
| 3 | Working-Memory Features | Adaptive chunking, replay API, glossary reconciliation | Planned |
| 4 | Knowledge Graph & Ontology | Contradiction detection, multi-user collaboration, conflict resolution | Vision |

Current version: **0.2.0**  
Target runtime: Node.js 16 or newer.

## Key Capabilities

### Operational Components

* Thought bubbles with titles, descriptions, tags, and colour coding.  
* Nested segments within each thought, each with its own attributes.  
* Attribute-based filtering with optional canvas highlighting.  
* JSON import and export for data portability and AI integration.  
* Normalised SQLite schema for reliable local persistence.  
* Foundational plug-in host implemented with a vm2 sandbox.

### Infrastructure Under Construction (Phase 2)

* Multi-language plug-in runtime (Node.js operational; Python in progress).  
* Secure DevShell interface for development commands.  
* TaskEngine for workflow orchestration.  
* LLM gateway with audit logging and runner isolation.  
* Observability stack (structured logging, health checks, performance metrics).

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 16 or newer  
* npm  
* Git

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshhickson/LogoMesh.git
cd LogoMesh
npm install
cd server && npm install && cd ..
```

### Running in Development

```bash
# Terminal 1 – back end (port 3001)
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 – front end (port 3000)
npm start
```

* Front-end: <http://localhost:3000>  
* API root: <http://localhost:3001/api/v1>

### Database Configuration

An SQLite database file is created automatically. To override the location or use another engine, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the connection string.

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/custom.db
# Example for PostgreSQL:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
```

## High-Level Architecture

```
React Front-end  →  Express API  →  SQLite (or configured RDBMS)
        │                  │
   UI Components       Core Services
                       - IdeaManager
                       - EventBus
                       - PluginHost
                       - TaskEngine (under development)
```

*Front-end technologies:* React 18, Cytoscape.js for graph rendering, Tailwind CSS for layout.  
*Back-end technologies:* Express.js with TypeScript, vm2 plug-in sandbox, structured logging with pino.

## Development Guide

### Repository Layout

```
/src/           React front-end
/server/src/    Express back-end
/core/          Shared business logic
/contracts/     TypeScript interfaces
/plugins/       Plug-in ecosystem
/docs/          Architectural records and specifications
```

### Routine Tasks

```bash
# Front-end unit tests

## Roadmap Extract

### Immediate Objectives (Phase 2)

| Category | Task |
|----------|------|
| Type safety | Eliminate remaining JavaScript in `/core` and `/server` |
| Security | Finalise plug-in sandbox and DevShell permissions |
| Observability | Health-check endpoint, structured logs, back-pressure metrics |
| Task engine | Workflow chain: LLM → plug-in → system |
| Local LLM | Initial Ollama executor with audit logging |

### Subsequent Milestones

* **Phase 2 b:** Vector store integration and summarisation plug-ins.  
* **Phase 3:** Automatic document digestion and replay API.  
* **Phase 4:** Multi-user knowledge graph with ontology management.

Detailed architectural records (ADR) and requests for comment (RFC) are maintained under `/docs/`.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.  
2. Follow the coding standards: TypeScript in new back-end code, ESLint and Prettier formatting.  
3. Include unit tests for new functionality and update documentation where relevant.  
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the change.

Architectural changes require an accompanying RFC in `/docs/rfc` before implementation.
