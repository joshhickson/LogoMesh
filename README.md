# AgentX Gauntlet Submission: The Green Agent for Contextual Debt

This repository contains our submission for the AgentX Gauntlet competition. We have developed a "Green Agent," a specialized AI agent designed to analyze and quantify the "Contextual Debt" of code generated by other AI agents.

## Project Summary

Our Green Agent introduces a new benchmark for evaluating the quality of AI-generated code. Instead of just measuring task completion, our agent scores submissions on three key dimensions of engineering quality:

1.  **Rationale:** How clear and well-reasoned is the explanation behind the code?
2.  **Architecture:** Is the code well-structured and maintainable?
3.  **Testing:** Are the tests thorough and do they cover edge cases?

The agent aggregates these scores into a single **Contextual Debt Score**, providing a more holistic measure of an AI agent's performance.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to see our system in action is to run the full end-to-end test suite. This will start our Green Agent server, a mock "Purple Agent" competitor, and then run a full evaluation.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Run the End-to-End Test

```bash
pnpm test
```

This command will run all tests, including the end-to-end test that validates the entire evaluation workflow.

## API Usage

The Green Agent exposes a single API endpoint for running evaluations.

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/evaluate`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "purple_agent_endpoint": "http://<url_of_agent_to_test>/a2a"
}
```

**Example `curl` Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/evaluate \\
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
-d '{ "purple_agent_endpoint": "http://localhost:3002/a2a" }'
```

*(Note: This example assumes you are running the mock agent on port 3002)*
