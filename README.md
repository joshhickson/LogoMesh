# LogoMesh: An Open Platform for Agent-on-Agent Evaluation

Welcome to the LogoMesh project! This repository contains the source code for a next-generation platform designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of advanced AI agents.

Our mission is to create a new benchmark for AI safety and reliability, framed through the lens of our core concept: **Contextual Debt**.

## Getting Started

As a new team member, your first step is to get a complete picture of our project's vision, current status, and strategic goals. We've prepared a detailed document that will bring you up to speed.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of:
*   Our strategic vision for the "Cyber-Sentinel Agent".
*   The core concept of "Contextual Debt".
*   The current technical state of the platform.
*   A gap analysis outlining the key areas where you can make an impact.

### Development Environment

To set up your local environment, please follow these steps:

**1. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pnpm install
```

**2. Current Status:**
Please be aware that the project's build is currently blocked by a known Redis connection issue. The `test:e2e` script will not run successfully at this time. This is our top priority to resolve after you are fully onboarded. We believe in transparency and want you to have a clear picture of the project's state from day one.
