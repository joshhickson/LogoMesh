**Tagline:**
> A recursive thought engine for humans and AI ‚Äî designed to evolve meaning, resolve contradictions, and externalize self-reflection.

LogoMesh is a powerful cognitive framework that allows you to create, organize, and navigate complex ideas through interconnected nodes (thought bubbles), nested segments, and flexible metadata filtering. Built as a **local-first, AI-augmented system** with a React frontend and Node.js backend.

---

## Current Status

**Phase:** Infrastructure Stabilization (Pre-Phase 2)  
**Version:** 0.2.0  
**Architecture:** React Frontend + Node.js/Express Backend + SQLite Database

‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Notice:** This project is in pre-alpha with active infrastructure improvements. Some features may be unstable.

## Features

### Core Functionality (Operational)
* **Thought Bubbles** with customizable titles, descriptions, tags, and colors
* **Nested Segments** within each thought with detailed content and attributes
* **Multi-attribute Classification** for powerful data structuring
* **Advanced Filtering** by field name, type, and value with canvas highlighting
* **JSON Export/Import** for data portability and AI integration
* **SQLite Backend** with normalized schema for reliable data persistence
* **Plugin System Foundation** with runtime interface scaffolding

### Infrastructure (In Development)
* **Multi-Language Plugin Runtime** - Support for Node.js and Python plugins
* **DevShell Interface** - Secure command environment for development
* **Task Engine** - Workflow orchestration and automation
* **LLM Integration Layer** - Local model support with audit logging
* **Vector Storage Foundations** - Semantic search preparation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshhickson/LogoMesh.git
   cd LogoMesh
   npm install
   cd server && npm install && cd ..
   ```

2. **Start Development Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend (Port 3001)
   cd server && npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend (Port 3000) 
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access Application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001/api/v1

### Database Configuration

**Default (SQLite):** No configuration needed - database file created automatically.

**Custom Database:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/custom.db
# Or PostgreSQL: postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
```

## Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (React/Cytoscape.js) ‚Üê‚Üí Backend API (Express) ‚Üê‚Üí SQLite Database
        ‚Üì                              ‚Üì
   UI Components                  Core Services
   - Canvas                       - IdeaManager
   - Sidebar                      - EventBus  
   - Modals                       - PluginHost
                                  - TaskEngine (planned)
```

### Current Components

**Frontend Layer:**
- React 18 with modern hooks
- Cytoscape.js for graph visualization
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Backend Layer:**
- Express.js API server with TypeScript
- SQLite with normalized schema
- Plugin system architecture
- Comprehensive audit logging

**Core Services:**
- `IdeaManager`: Business logic and thought operations
- `EventBus`: Pub/sub system for component coordination
- `PluginHost`: Plugin runtime management (foundation)
- `StorageAdapter`: Database abstraction layer

  "id": "thought-001",
  "title": "Example Thought", 
  "description": "High-level concept",
  "tags": [{"name": "philosophy", "color": "#f97316"}],
  "segments": [
    {
      "id": "segment-001",
      "title": "Key Point",
      "content": "Detailed information...",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "fieldName": "Category",
          "fieldValue": "Quote", 
          "fieldType": "text"
        }
      ]
