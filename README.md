# Welcome to the Cyber-Sentinel Agent Project! 🛡️

**Our Mission: To build a groundbreaking AI agent that can judge the quality and security of other AI-generated code, and to win the AgentX AgentBeats competition!**

---

Hello team, and welcome!

You've just joined a project at the cutting edge of agentic AI. We're not just building another coding agent; we're building an **"Agent-as-a-Judge."** Our "Cyber-Sentinel" will be a sophisticated evaluator that can analyze code for "Contextual Debt"—the hidden costs of poorly-reasoned, badly-architected, and insecure code that other AI agents often produce.

This is an ambitious goal, but we have a solid plan, a great team, and a real chance to create something that will be recognized by leaders in the field.

## Your Journey Starts Here 👇

This repository contains everything we need to succeed, but don't feel overwhelmed! We've created a central document that explains our entire strategy.

**Your absolute first step is to read our Project Plan.** It's our team's single source of truth.

### **[➡️ START HERE: Read the Project Plan](./PROJECT_PLAN.md)**

This plan will walk you through:
*   Our full vision for the "Cyber-Sentinel Agent."
*   The new multi-agent architecture we will build.
*   Your specific role on the team and what you'll be learning.
*   Our week-by-week timeline to the submission deadline.

Once you've read the plan, you'll be directed to our structured onboarding documents to get you fully up to speed.

## For the Technically Curious (Coders!)

If you're eager to dive into the code, our project is a `pnpm` monorepo built with TypeScript. The quickest way to see the *current* (soon-to-be-upgraded!) system in action is to run the end-to-end test suite.

**1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pnpm install
```

**2. Run the End-to-End Test**
```bash
pnpm test
```
*(**Note:** This will test the old architecture. The fun part will be building the new one together!)*

Let's get started. We're excited to have you on the team!
