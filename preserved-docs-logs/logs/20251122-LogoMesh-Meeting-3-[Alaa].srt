03:58:42,433 --> 03:58:44,233
<b>I use QCLI.</b>

122
03:58:47,433 --> 03:58:49,433
<b>So it's Amazon's coding agent.</b>

123
03:58:52,600 --> 03:58:53,133
<b>Pretty useful.</b>

124
03:58:54,933 --> 03:58:55,133
<b>Yeah.</b>

125
03:58:57,866 --> 03:59:01,133
<b>So it runs on the command line, and you can sort of guide</b>

126
03:59:01,133 --> 03:59:04,066
<b>it through which tools to use from the command line,</b>

127
03:59:04,133 --> 03:59:07,399
<b>which sort of workspaces to look into.</b>

128
03:59:08,866 --> 03:59:11,600
<b>It's similar to what CoPilot</b>

129
03:59:11,600 --> 03:59:13,433
<b>does, but a lot better, I think.</b>

130
03:59:13,433 --> 03:59:14,566
<b>And you have more control once</b>

131
03:59:14,566 --> 03:59:17,366
<b>you're using it from the command line.</b>

132
03:59:18,266 --> 03:59:23,266
<b>You get to sort of...</b>

133
03:59:27,233 --> 03:59:31,733
<b>Not to open an application with a GUI, but to sort of use a</b>

134
03:59:31,733 --> 03:59:33,100
<b>tool that you already have installed.</b>

135
03:59:34,100 --> 03:59:39,500
<b>So say, for example, when I want to come up with...</b>

136
03:59:40,266 --> 03:59:44,233
<b>When I want to create a JSON file, I don't like to build</b>

137
03:59:44,233 --> 03:59:47,566
<b>the prompts by myself, so I sort of use it and tell it to</b>

138
03:59:47,566 --> 03:59:52,133
<b>use this software that I have, this JQ...</b>

139
03:59:52,866 --> 03:59:56,366
<b>JSON query software, and it can sort of navigate how to use</b>

140
03:59:56,366 --> 03:59:58,500
<b>it if you give it documentation or</b>

141
03:59:58,500 --> 03:59:59,966
<b>if it's already been trained on it.</b>

142
03:59:59,966 --> 04:00:02,033
<b>If it's a well-known software, then</b>

143
04:00:02,033 --> 04:00:03,100
<b>it already does know how to use it.</b>

144
04:00:04,133 --> 04:00:07,299
<b>And you can sort of guide it through which tools that you</b>

145
04:00:07,299 --> 04:00:09,866
<b>wanted to use, and it sort of...</b>

146
04:00:10,933 --> 04:00:14,133
<b>Yeah, you approve each one of the commands that it comes up</b>

147
04:00:14,133 --> 04:00:17,666
<b>with, and it does a loop where, you know, if it makes a</b>

148
04:00:17,666 --> 04:00:19,533
<b>mistake, it sort of reiterates, and</b>

149
04:00:19,533 --> 04:00:23,700
<b>until, yeah, it does what you ask it to.</b>

150
04:00:24,700 --> 04:00:30,866
<b>And you can also trust it, but trust it to run commands</b>

151
04:00:30,866 --> 04:00:33,100
<b>without your approval, but on the side, I don't trust it.</b>

152
04:00:35,866 --> 04:00:36,066
<b>Yeah.</b>

153
04:00:36,133 --> 04:00:46,033
<b>[Silence]</b>

154
04:00:53,133 --> 04:00:59,033
<b>You just... Yeah, it runs... It doesn't run locally, but</b>

155
04:00:59,033 --> 04:01:06,000
<b>you just install the QCLI thingy, and then it sort of asks</b>

156
04:01:06,000 --> 04:01:11,233
<b>for your Amazon credentials and whatnot, and you get a free</b>

157
04:01:11,233 --> 04:01:13,666
<b>trial, but then you might... Yeah.</b>

158
04:01:14,033 --> 04:01:15,866
<b>At some point, it tells you, "Okay, you're</b>

159
04:01:15,866 --> 04:01:17,066
<b>going to have to pay for the pro-lytheon."</b>

160
04:01:18,100 --> 04:01:25,700
<b>So, I think it uses Clod in the backend. Like, most of the</b>

161
04:01:25,700 --> 04:01:27,533
<b>work is done through, yeah, Clod.</b>

162
04:01:28,833 --> 04:01:30,433
<b>But Amazon sort of builds the</b>

163
04:01:30,433 --> 04:01:32,566
<b>tooling around it, and, you know...</b>

164
04:01:33,633 --> 04:01:36,066
<b>It is. Honestly, it is.</b>

<b>[Silence]</b>

166
04:01:50,200 --> 04:01:55,033
<b>I think... Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's sort</b>

167
04:01:55,033 --> 04:01:58,066
<b>of what OpenAI Atlas does, I think, right?</b>

168
04:01:58,133 --> 04:02:02,899
<b>And I think, for Flexity, they sort of launch the browser</b>

169
04:02:02,899 --> 04:02:05,133
<b>that does the same thing, whereas, like, an agentic</b>

179

<b>So, let me just cut into that way you refer to with</b>

180
04:02:57,200 --> 04:03:01,433
<b>contextual depth, where it's sort of the model's doing what</b>

<b>you're telling it to, and then at some point, it starts to</b>

182

<b>[Silence]</b>

194
04:03:59,333 --> 04:04:01,433
<b>Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. Yeah, I read that</b>

195
04:04:01,433 --> 04:04:03,266
<b>as well, yeah. Very interesting concept.</b>

196
04:04:06,166 --> 04:04:10,533
<b>And, okay, and what you're imagining for the evaluation,</b>

197
04:04:10,533 --> 04:04:14,566
<b>would it be like a step-by-step evaluation, or sort of a</b>

198
04:04:14,566 --> 04:04:17,233
<b>post hoc evaluation after everything's done, or...</b>

<b>[Silence]</b>

203
04:04:46,733 --> 04:04:49,500
<b>Sorry, maybe I didn't understand those concepts well. So,</b>

204
04:04:49,500 --> 04:04:53,066
<b>the green agent is the one that's being evaluated, and the</b>

205
04:04:53,066 --> 04:04:56,333
<b>purple one's the evaluator, or is it something? Is it...</b>

206
04:04:58,766 --> 04:05:00,899
<b>Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. Which is, the</b>

207
04:05:00,899 --> 04:05:03,100
<b>evaluator is the green agent, sorry.</b>

208
04:05:05,433 --> 04:05:05,533
<b>Okay.</b>

209
04:05:07,100 --> 04:05:11,200
<b>Yeah, yeah, okay. The purple's the evaluated. I think, is</b>

210
04:05:11,200 --> 04:05:12,633
<b>there a word, a better word for</b>

211
04:05:12,633 --> 04:05:15,299
<b>this, than the evaluated agent?</b>

212
04:05:16,433 --> 04:05:18,133
<b>I'm looking... Yeah, okay.</b>

213
04:05:21,299 --> 04:05:24,066
<b>But it's fine.</b>

214
04:05:24,100 --> 04:05:24,299
<b>And...</b>

215
04:05:29,366 --> 04:05:32,133
<b>The competing agent, okay. Since there is more than one,</b>

216
04:05:32,133 --> 04:05:35,133
<b>and you sort of... Yeah, okay,</b>

217
04:05:35,133 --> 04:05:37,933
<b>they're competing. Yeah, okay. Makes sense.</b>

218
04:05:39,533 --> 04:05:44,966
<b>[Silence]</b>

219
04:05:47,833 --> 04:05:54,233
<b>[Silence]</b>

220
04:05:55,100 --> 04:05:56,666
<b>Uh-huh, okay. And...</b>

221
04:05:58,100 --> 04:06:01,766
<b>So, the purple agents are not in our control, basically, is</b>

222
04:06:01,766 --> 04:06:04,633
<b>what I'm trying to ask, because I know for</b>

223
04:06:04,633 --> 04:06:06,866
<b>sure some agents do provide their reasoning.</b>

224
04:06:08,100 --> 04:06:11,833
<b>And those are most of the open source ones, but ones like</b>

225
04:06:11,833 --> 04:06:14,033
<b>Chat GPT, they're sort of</b>

226
04:06:14,033 --> 04:06:17,033
<b>obscured, and cloud as well, I think.</b>

227
04:06:18,433 --> 04:06:21,766
<b>So, if that's the thing that we're trying to evaluate, I</b>

228
04:06:21,766 --> 04:06:25,233
<b>think we'd need to come up with a method.</b>

229
04:06:27,466 --> 04:06:29,100
<b>Sorry, yeah. Mm-hmm.</b>

230
04:06:37,133 --> 04:06:48,066

04:06:49,166 --> 04:06:49,533
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

232
04:06:53,466 --> 04:06:55,333
<b>Uh, I might have just skimmed</b>

233
04:06:55,333 --> 04:06:58,000
<b>through it, to be honest, so... Yeah.</b>

234
04:07:00,366 --> 04:07:00,666
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

235
04:07:02,799 --> 04:07:03,100
<b>Okay.</b>

236
04:07:08,100 --> 04:07:09,233
<b>Yeah.</b>

237
04:07:15,166 --> 04:07:16,066
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

238
04:07:16,666 --> 04:07:16,866
<b>Good.</b>

239
04:07:19,533 --> 04:07:19,966
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

240
04:07:23,933 --> 04:07:27,933
<b>Aha, okay. Mm-hmm.</b>

241
04:07:29,166 --> 04:07:29,366
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

242
04:07:35,100 --> 04:07:36,100
<b>Okay.</b>

243
04:07:39,366 --> 04:07:39,866
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

244
04:07:45,666 --> 04:07:54,866
<b>[Silence]</b>

245
04:07:56,100 --> 04:07:56,333
<b>Mm.</b>

246
04:08:01,866 --> 04:08:02,833
<b>Okay, so...</b>

247
04:08:03,933 --> 04:08:04,066
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

248
04:08:05,100 --> 04:08:05,133
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

249
04:08:06,766 --> 04:08:07,066
<b>Yeah.</b>

250
04:08:08,133 --> 04:08:14,233
<b>So, the why is inferred, it's not provided by the agent,</b>

251
04:08:14,700 --> 04:08:17,533
<b>the competitive agent, is it? Yeah.</b>

252
04:08:19,766 --> 04:08:23,566
<b>[Silence]</b>

253
04:08:23,566 --> 04:08:29,166
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

254
04:08:37,066 --> 04:08:37,766
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

255
04:08:42,200 --> 04:08:42,566
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

256
04:08:45,533 --> 04:08:48,633
<b>Okay. So, it's not inferred from the code, from the</b>

257
04:08:48,633 --> 04:08:52,066
<b>generated code, but rather from what the agent is saying</b>

258
04:08:52,066 --> 04:08:53,366
<b>while it's building the code.</b>

259
04:08:55,433 --> 04:08:57,666
<b>Like, yeah, the rationale.</b>

260
04:08:58,000 --> 04:09:00,799
<b>[Silence]</b>

261
04:09:04,133 --> 04:09:15,266
<b>[Silence]</b>

262
04:09:15,266 --> 04:09:21,533
<b>Yeah. I think the problem would be that the evaluation</b>

263
04:09:21,533 --> 04:09:25,066
<b>would be biased towards the evaluator agent,</b>

264
04:09:26,100 --> 04:09:30,533
<b>because it's the one inferring the rationale from the code.</b>

265
04:09:32,066 --> 04:09:37,066
<b>But if there is another way where the competitive agent is</b>

266
04:09:37,066 --> 04:09:39,000
<b>the one that's saying, "Okay, I</b>

267
04:09:39,000 --> 04:09:40,533
<b>built this, but it's purpose,"</b>

268
04:09:41,100 --> 04:09:44,766
<b>then the evaluator agent can sort of judge that and say,</b>

269
04:09:44,966 --> 04:09:48,366
<b>"Okay, but that's not the reason</b>

270
04:09:48,366 --> 04:09:50,066
<b>why you're supposed to do that,"</b>

271
04:09:50,133 --> 04:09:54,566
<b>and that sort of can be quantified, I'm not sure.</b>

272
04:09:56,299 --> 04:09:59,666
<b>Yeah, I agree. I think it would be best to request that the</b>

273
04:09:59,666 --> 04:10:02,100
<b>competitive agent provides comments in its code or</b>

274
04:10:02,100 --> 04:10:03,733
<b>documentation to support its code</b>

275
04:10:03,733 --> 04:10:06,233
<b>so that we can use the code with the rationale.</b>

276
04:10:08,433 --> 04:10:14,233
<b>When I kind of design this, I typically start out with a</b>

277
04:10:14,233 --> 04:10:15,600
<b>high-level overview like this,</b>

278
04:10:15,600 --> 04:10:17,066
<b>and then I try and flush it out</b>

279
04:10:17,100 --> 04:10:20,766
<b>and try and see if there's any research papers out there</b>

280
04:10:20,766 --> 04:10:23,733
<b>that kind of have anything to do with this.</b>

281
04:10:24,366 --> 04:10:28,666
<b>I also use Gemini to try and generate some logic that we</b>

282
04:10:28,666 --> 04:10:29,966
<b>may be able to work with and</b>

283
04:10:29,966 --> 04:10:32,500
<b>then research that logic itself.</b>

284
04:10:33,533 --> 04:10:37,299
<b>So I have a paper that kind of, I have a document I can</b>

285
04:10:37,299 --> 04:10:37,966
<b>share with you in the</b>

286

<b>repository that goes deeper into this,</b>

<b>but when I shared it with the rest of the team earlier</b>

04:10:54,833 --> 04:10:57,333
<b>us really understood graph theory.</b>

291
04:10:58,566 --> 04:11:02,066
<b>I'm definitely not a math major. It's a lot of logic.</b>

292
04:11:03,100 --> 04:11:05,666
<b>I was hoping maybe you might be able to take a look at it</b>

293
04:11:05,666 --> 04:11:08,033
<b>and see if you could decipher it, but otherwise I'm just</b>

294
04:11:08,033 --> 04:11:09,966
<b>going to process it in the way that I</b>

295
04:11:09,966 --> 04:11:12,033
<b>normally do and I don't understand things.</b>

296
04:11:13,033 --> 04:11:14,633
<b>Yeah, sure. I'm happy to have a look.</b>

297
04:11:15,133 --> 04:11:20,533
<b>Sure, let me find it. Here it is, proposed section 2.2. So</b>

298
04:11:20,533 --> 04:11:21,066
<b>I'll just send you the link here.</b>

299
04:11:22,100 --> 04:11:29,533
<b>Yeah, and really do not be worried if you can't understand</b>

300
04:11:29,533 --> 04:11:32,633
<b>it. I'm still trying to piece it</b>

301
04:11:32,633 --> 04:11:35,633
<b>together myself because it's a lot of math.</b>

302
04:11:35,633 --> 04:11:37,333
<b>Yeah, it's math heavy.</b>

303
04:11:37,933 --> 04:11:44,366
<b>It's very math heavy, but we do need quantifiable math and</b>

304
04:11:44,366 --> 04:11:47,033
<b>functions for this three pillars. So</b>

305
04:11:47,033 --> 04:11:48,100
<b>it's important that we go over this.</b>

306
04:11:51,133 --> 04:11:51,466
<b>Cool.</b>

307
04:11:54,266 --> 04:12:04,466
<b>I think I also had a couple of</b>

308
04:12:04,466 --> 04:12:07,633
<b>questions. No, I think we covered.</b>

309
04:12:09,066 --> 04:12:10,066
<b>How about the ones that you sent over Discord?</b>

310
04:12:11,100 --> 04:12:17,233
<b>Yeah, but also, do we have, I mean, we might have to look</b>

311
04:12:17,233 --> 04:12:20,066
<b>for a benchmark. Are we planning to</b>

312
04:12:20,066 --> 04:12:22,733
<b>sort of come up with our own benchmark?</b>

313
04:12:25,066 --> 04:12:28,066
<b>I think Aaron came up with that similar question too.</b>

314
04:12:29,566 --> 04:12:36,366
<b>And sort of what would be the ground truth as well for the</b>

315
04:12:36,366 --> 04:12:39,200
<b>scoring? So would those be like</b>

316
04:12:39,200 --> 04:12:42,333
<b>manual annotations provided by us?</b>

317
04:12:43,399 --> 04:12:46,666
<b>Because we can't like 100% rely on</b>

318
04:12:46,666 --> 04:12:49,933
<b>the outputs of the evaluator, right?</b>

319
04:12:50,700 --> 04:12:54,733
<b>I think we do ideally need some swimming in the loop.</b>

320
04:12:56,100 --> 04:12:57,100
<b>Yeah.</b>

321
04:12:58,133 --> 04:12:59,166
<b>Let me see.</b>

322
04:12:59,166 --> 04:13:01,166
<b>But sorry, you were saying, yeah.</b>

323
04:13:02,333 --> 04:13:03,433
<b>Let me see if I can find any</b>

324
04:13:03,433 --> 04:13:05,766
<b>documentation on that really quick.</b>

325
04:13:09,066 --> 04:13:19,433
<b>Hold on. I think I had something that mentioned that</b>

326
04:13:19,433 --> 04:13:21,433
<b>somewhere. So I'm just running a search right now.</b>

327
04:13:23,466 --> 04:13:24,866
<b>Sorry for the delay. There's just</b>

328
04:13:24,866 --> 04:13:27,100
<b>so much going on with this, you know.</b>

329
04:13:28,200 --> 04:13:32,500
<b>Not at all. I know it's like 1.30 over there.</b>

330
04:13:33,266 --> 04:13:33,533
<b>Yeah.</b>

331
04:13:34,299 --> 04:13:42,433
<b>Yeah, the meeting went well, but it also revealed like a</b>

332
04:13:42,433 --> 04:13:43,866
<b>lot of confusion surrounding the</b>

333
04:13:43,866 --> 04:13:47,266
<b>documentation because there's a lot of doc files.</b>

334
04:13:47,833 --> 04:13:51,166
<b>And I'm in the process of consolidating those tonight.</b>

335
04:13:52,533 --> 04:13:53,066
<b>Okay, so.</b>

336
04:13:53,100 --> 04:14:02,566
<b>Yes, so there is a key section in this file. This is my</b>

337
04:14:02,566 --> 04:14:06,299
<b>draft kind of research paper. This is an this is in.</b>

338
04:14:08,000 --> 04:14:09,033
<b>Really draft. Let me see.</b>

339
04:14:11,766 --> 04:14:15,366
<b>Okay, so this is the by the way, I</b>

340
04:14:15,366 --> 04:14:16,833
<b>generated this. I didn't write this.</b>

341
04:14:18,299 --> 04:14:18,700
<b>But</b>

342
04:14:19,100 --> 04:14:20,066
<b>it's</b>

343
04:14:20,466 --> 04:14:24,666
<b>it's relevant. Okay.</b>

344
04:14:25,966 --> 04:14:31,399
<b>Okay, so I'll tell you where exactly you can find that</b>

345
04:14:31,399 --> 04:14:34,966
<b>section then about to kind of cover really quick summarize.</b>

346
04:14:36,633 --> 04:14:37,066
<b>So.</b>

347
04:14:37,866 --> 04:14:38,233
<b>So.</b>

348
04:14:41,866 --> 04:14:44,866
<b>It's so if it argues for human in the loop accountability,</b>

349
04:14:45,566 --> 04:14:49,299
<b>but it also states that those kinds of checkpoints, they're</b>

350
04:14:49,299 --> 04:14:52,000
<b>not scalable. Like if you try and scale up.</b>

351
04:14:52,866 --> 04:14:57,533
<b>So there's there is so in when I</b>

352
04:14:57,533 --> 04:14:58,066
<b>was researching the competition.</b>

353
04:14:59,100 --> 04:15:03,566
<b>It mentions asynchronous authorization is a feature that</b>

354
04:15:03,566 --> 04:15:06,633
<b>enables human in the loop approval workflows for high</b>

355
04:15:06,633 --> 04:15:08,966
<b>stakes actions. So it doesn't mean we</b>

356
04:15:08,966 --> 04:15:11,533
<b>can't use it. We can definitely use it.</b>

357
04:15:13,733 --> 04:15:14,200
<b>There is</b>

358
04:15:14,200 --> 04:15:16,133
<b>let's see.</b>

359
04:15:17,366 --> 04:15:22,066
<b>Okay, so</b>

360
04:15:22,299 --> 04:15:27,000
<b>you say how you mean like well, the agents. Yeah, sorry.</b>

361
04:15:27,533 --> 04:15:29,666
<b>I'm sorry. I didn't I didn't explain the how.</b>

362
04:15:30,799 --> 04:15:31,399
<b>So</b>

363
04:15:33,100 --> 04:15:36,066
<b>I don't think it's been covered deeply enough.</b>

364
04:15:44,533 --> 04:15:50,799
<b>I need specific I'm using using my coding agent to try and</b>

365
04:15:50,799 --> 04:15:55,433
<b>find specific practical applications of human in the</b>

366
04:15:55,433 --> 04:15:56,066
<b>planning of the documentation.</b>

367
04:15:56,399 --> 04:16:02,533
<b>Yeah, because a lot of some of this</b>

368
04:16:02,533 --> 04:16:04,466
<b>has been pushed out to the point of</b>

369
04:16:06,000 --> 04:16:07,633
<b>that logic here, but a lot of this is</b>

370
04:16:08,100 --> 04:16:11,966
<b>kind of just like the foundation of skeleton of the code.</b>

371
04:16:12,299 --> 04:16:14,100
<b>So I'm not sure if that's been decided yet.</b>

372
04:16:26,133 --> 04:16:35,133
<b>Okay, give it a second.</b>

373
04:16:38,100 --> 04:16:38,533
<b>See.</b>

374
04:16:50,233 --> 04:16:50,466
<b>Okay.</b>

375
04:16:58,299 --> 04:17:11,133
<b>Okay.</b>

376
04:17:11,133 --> 04:17:14,833
<b>Oh, boy. Yeah, I'm sorry. I think I think I need to.</b>

377
04:17:16,600 --> 04:17:18,933
<b>I don't have a good answer for this question.</b>

378
04:17:22,133 --> 04:17:24,033
<b>I know it's fine.</b>

379
04:17:24,766 --> 04:17:27,166
<b>This is really good. And I'm glad that you brought it up.</b>

380
04:17:27,833 --> 04:17:32,733
<b>So I think I should create a text channel called</b>

381
04:17:35,466 --> 04:17:36,366
<b>questions really quick.</b>

382
04:17:38,233 --> 04:17:42,533
<b>Then, yeah, if you could if you could type that question</b>

383
04:17:42,533 --> 04:17:44,600
<b>out and then put it in the checks channel and then I can</b>

384
04:17:44,600 --> 04:17:47,366
<b>come back to it. I'm also consolidating all of the other</b>

385
04:17:47,366 --> 04:17:49,066
<b>questions from the team meeting to</b>

386
04:17:50,100 --> 04:17:54,399
<b>because there was there were questions about like whether</b>

387
04:17:55,100 --> 04:17:58,600
<b>like how we're going to handle the scoring rubric aside</b>

388
04:17:58,600 --> 04:18:00,399
<b>from just the contextual integrity</b>

389
04:18:00,399 --> 04:18:02,833
<b>score like a three pillars part of it.</b>

390
04:18:04,366 --> 04:18:05,233
<b>Like, you know, what kind of</b>

391
04:18:05,233 --> 04:18:07,399
<b>assignments we would give the purple agents.</b>

392
04:18:08,933 --> 04:18:10,766
<b>But I guess at the same time, it's like</b>

393
04:18:12,133 --> 04:18:14,433
<b>would that be something that the judges would do at the</b>

394
04:18:14,433 --> 04:18:16,066
<b>same time and in order to evaluate the green agent.</b>

395
04:18:17,100 --> 04:18:20,433
<b>It's maybe something we have to take consideration to.</b>

396
04:18:21,799 --> 04:18:23,233
<b>I don't know. How do you how do</b>

397
04:18:23,233 --> 04:18:25,066
<b>you feel about this? Honest thoughts?</b>

398
04:18:27,000 --> 04:18:28,666
<b>I feel it has potential to be</b>

399
04:18:28,666 --> 04:18:30,866
<b>honest. There's a lot of potential.</b>

400
04:18:32,766 --> 04:18:38,333
<b>In terms of the scenario itself. I think there's like a</b>

401
04:18:38,333 --> 04:18:41,100
<b>scenario that I kind of shared with you where it's like</b>

402
04:18:41,100 --> 04:18:44,066
<b>sort of related to the cyber security domain where</b>

403
04:18:44,100 --> 04:18:52,766
<b>the agents could be tasked with building something that's</b>

404
04:18:52,766 --> 04:18:56,399
<b>I don't know, like sort of sensitive and</b>

405
04:18:56,399 --> 04:19:01,066
<b>then the evaluator would decide whether but that would be</b>

406
04:19:01,066 --> 04:19:03,766
<b>only for the to evaluate the quality.</b>

407
04:19:03,966 --> 04:19:06,566
<b>So there's like three scores if I recall correctly.</b>

408
04:19:06,833 --> 04:19:09,533
<b>There's the contextual depth,</b>

409
04:19:09,533 --> 04:19:12,066
<b>which is evaluating the rationale.</b>

410
04:19:12,133 --> 04:19:19,166
<b>The second one had to do with the</b>

411
04:19:19,166 --> 04:19:21,733
<b>code itself, the architecture. Right. So</b>

412
04:19:21,733 --> 04:19:27,299
<b>I guess that means whether it's like there's a lot of</b>

413
04:19:27,299 --> 04:19:31,833
<b>boilerplate code and whether there's any vulnerabilities.</b>

414
04:19:31,833 --> 04:19:34,733
<b>At least that's how I understood it. But I'm not sure.</b>

415
04:19:37,033 --> 04:19:39,766
<b>And then there's the test. So unit test.</b>

416
04:19:40,033 --> 04:19:41,100
<b>Honestly, I'm not too familiar with unit test.</b>

417
04:19:43,266 --> 04:19:46,666
<b>So that's the integrity score. Yeah, I'm not too familiar</b>

418
04:19:46,666 --> 04:19:48,600
<b>with that because I'm sort of</b>

419
04:19:48,600 --> 04:19:50,899
<b>more of a theoretical kind of.</b>

420
04:19:52,233 --> 04:19:56,533
<b>Yeah. Oh, it's OK. It's OK. I do know somebody.</b>

421
04:19:57,399 --> 04:20:00,466
<b>I forgot his name. One of our teammates. He's going to be</b>

422
04:20:00,466 --> 04:20:04,533
<b>focused more on the testing and quality of the code because</b>

423
04:20:04,533 --> 04:20:06,733
<b>it sounds like he's kind of specializes in that.</b>

424
04:20:07,766 --> 04:20:10,100
<b>OK. I'm hoping he can provide some feedback on that too.</b>

425
04:20:13,100 --> 04:20:19,133
<b>But yeah, like this scenario and contextual relevance of</b>

426
04:20:19,133 --> 04:20:25,633
<b>like the test suite against the requirements of the code.</b>

427
04:20:28,333 --> 04:20:31,533
<b>But but yeah, the scenario is the thing</b>

428
04:20:31,533 --> 04:20:34,000
<b>right that we're supposed to be discussing.</b>

429
04:20:35,100 --> 04:20:39,033
<b>Oh, sorry. Yeah, no, no worries.</b>

430
04:20:39,299 --> 04:20:40,066
<b>I was asking as well. I wasn't.</b>

431
04:20:41,100 --> 04:20:44,766
<b>I'm not sure. Also, this was sort of a</b>

432
04:20:44,766 --> 04:20:48,566
<b>question and a statement. So is it. Yeah.</b>

433
04:20:50,166 --> 04:20:51,333
<b>Like in terms of how we're going</b>

434
04:20:51,333 --> 04:20:52,633
<b>to be testing the purple agent.</b>

435
04:20:54,066 --> 04:20:56,333
<b>Yeah. So the task that it will be told to.</b>

436
04:20:58,466 --> 04:21:01,966
<b>OK. Yeah. So what I'm imagining right now is that we</b>

437
04:21:01,966 --> 04:21:04,066
<b>present purple agent a certain prompt.</b>

438
04:21:05,100 --> 04:21:10,333
<b>We have it in some point some kind of like right. We use</b>

439
04:21:10,333 --> 04:21:13,133
<b>the agent agent protocol to submit that prompt to it.</b>

440
04:21:14,466 --> 04:21:19,600
<b>And then it writes either. That's the</b>

441
04:21:19,600 --> 04:21:21,066
<b>thing. Like how deep can we get in this.</b>

442
04:21:21,066 --> 04:21:25,633
<b>Can we have it write a series of code files that kind of</b>

443
04:21:25,633 --> 04:21:29,933
<b>work with each other like even to the to the extent of like</b>

444
04:21:29,933 --> 04:21:30,066
<b>importing Python models and stuff.</b>

445
04:21:30,100 --> 04:21:35,433
<b>We might be able to get that far. Who knows. Yeah. I mean,</b>

446
04:21:35,433 --> 04:21:38,933
<b>honestly, I think you should play around a bit with QCLI</b>

447
04:21:38,933 --> 04:21:42,100
<b>and it will sort of give you an idea of how how capable</b>

448
04:21:42,100 --> 04:21:45,633
<b>these agentic these coding agents are.</b>

449
04:21:46,666 --> 04:21:47,966
<b>They can do a lot to be honest.</b>

450
04:21:47,966 --> 04:21:50,666
<b>They can be. How did you use QCLI?</b>

451
04:21:51,799 --> 04:21:56,233
<b>I did an internship with Amazon. So they were sort of.</b>

452
04:21:56,233 --> 04:21:58,066
<b>Yeah. They were pushing it on everyone because like I guess they want to lay off a lot of people.</b>

453
04:21:58,133 --> 04:22:01,466
<b>So they're like make our</b>

454
04:22:01,466 --> 04:22:05,299
<b>agents better so we can replace you.</b>

455
04:22:05,433 --> 04:22:08,799
<b>Well, yeah. And you're still sticking with it. Like it must</b>

456
04:22:08,799 --> 04:22:15,133
<b>be pretty good. It is. It is to be honest. And if you could</b>

457
04:22:15,133 --> 04:22:17,066
<b>sort of like some people trust it</b>

458
04:22:17,066 --> 04:22:18,633
<b>to like build an entire project.</b>

459
04:22:19,566 --> 04:22:24,166
<b>But they also ask it to commit. So to like sort of. Yeah.</b>

460
04:22:24,833 --> 04:22:27,100
<b>Yeah. They use get. So it can do a lot of impressive things even if you're like.</b>

461
04:22:28,100 --> 04:22:31,466
<b>Even that way. So I guess this is much closer to the</b>

462
04:22:31,466 --> 04:22:34,333
<b>problem that we're trying to solve. Right. Absolutely.</b>

463
04:22:34,933 --> 04:22:38,566
<b>Yeah. I see a lot of crossovers with this.</b>

464
04:22:39,066 --> 04:22:44,333
<b>I wonder. Yeah. I'll look into. I'll sort of. I'll start a</b>

465
04:22:44,333 --> 04:22:48,633
<b>deep research prompt right now for finding like a master</b>

466
04:22:48,633 --> 04:22:51,066
<b>class on how to you know free on how to learn QCLI.</b>

467
04:22:52,100 --> 04:22:57,833
<b>There is you don't need no master class to be honest. Like</b>

468
04:22:57,833 --> 04:23:01,833
<b>you just talk to it like sort of. It's yeah. It's just</b>

469
04:23:01,833 --> 04:23:04,366
<b>yeah. It was basically you can have</b>

470
04:23:04,366 --> 04:23:06,066
<b>it teach you a little bit like this is.</b>

471
04:23:07,100 --> 04:23:09,533
<b>Yeah. Obviously that's how I use there a lot of the times</b>

472
04:23:09,533 --> 04:23:13,233
<b>as well. Like my coding isn't great at all. So I kind of.</b>

473
04:23:13,700 --> 04:23:17,333
<b>Ask it and then I sort of review it code and we sort of</b>

474
04:23:17,333 --> 04:23:18,866
<b>learned at the same time we learned</b>

475
04:23:18,866 --> 04:23:21,333
<b>together and like it fucked up and I'm like.</b>

476
04:23:22,466 --> 04:23:25,133
<b>Yeah. And it finds out why it fucked up and then I tell it</b>

477
04:23:25,133 --> 04:23:27,066
<b>sometimes that you shouldn't be fucking up.</b>

478
04:23:27,333 --> 04:23:32,933
<b>Fucking up. So it's you don't really you don't really need</b>

479
04:23:32,933 --> 04:23:37,033
<b>any like coding or like any complex. I don't know.</b>

480
04:23:37,966 --> 04:23:41,799
<b>I didn't really. I meant like like metaphorically master</b>

481
04:23:41,799 --> 04:23:46,366
<b>class. Oh yeah. Okay. My. I'm just going to ask like Google</b>

482
04:23:46,366 --> 04:23:49,066
<b>Gemini to pull an assortment of like intro articles.</b>

483
04:23:49,133 --> 04:23:53,633
<b>Coding agents or I'm coding agents I guess right in general</b>

484
04:23:53,633 --> 04:23:58,966
<b>though. Oh yeah. Yeah because there's cursor there. Sorry.</b>

485
04:23:59,866 --> 04:24:03,466
<b>Yeah there's cursor and you can sort of load up any model</b>

486
04:24:03,466 --> 04:24:06,799
<b>there. I think if you I guess if you want to familiarize</b>

487
04:24:06,799 --> 04:24:09,733
<b>yourself with something that's more.</b>

488
04:24:11,100 --> 04:24:14,966
<b>I don't know broad. You might want to learn cursor. Right.</b>

489
04:24:15,399 --> 04:24:18,100
<b>I'll give that a shot. I feel like right now I use.</b>

490
04:24:20,100 --> 04:24:24,766
<b>I right now I use a visual studio code with get hub</b>

491
04:24:24,766 --> 04:24:30,866
<b>co-pilot. Yeah. Yeah. I've even used the root plug in the S</b>

492
04:24:30,866 --> 04:24:34,133
<b>code to import custom models using LM studio.</b>

493
04:24:35,433 --> 04:24:40,066
<b>Which which plug in sorry. I'll go live on.</b>

494
04:24:40,133 --> 04:24:44,566
<b>I can share my desktop screen. It's</b>

495
04:24:44,566 --> 04:24:49,866
<b>a plugin called Roo R.O.O. And okay.</b>

496
04:24:50,533 --> 04:24:57,299
<b>And now I forgot how you set it up. Oh</b>

497
04:24:57,299 --> 04:24:58,066
<b>it looks like you could do cloud agents.</b>

498
04:24:59,100 --> 04:25:07,133
<b>I forgot how I set it up but go to.</b>

499
04:25:09,100 --> 04:25:13,100
<b>So they have MCP access but what I did was I somehow</b>

500
04:25:13,100 --> 04:25:16,466
<b>connected it to this other application called LM studio.</b>

501
04:25:18,000 --> 04:25:21,166
<b>Which is basically a way for you to download quantized</b>

502
04:25:21,166 --> 04:25:22,066
<b>models and run them in your machine.</b>

503
04:25:23,100 --> 04:25:28,066
<b>They somehow communicate if you if you upload you download</b>

504
04:25:28,066 --> 04:25:32,433
<b>a model and you have the right specific</b>

505
04:25:32,433 --> 04:25:34,733
<b>one loaded. I think only certain ones were.</b>

506
04:25:35,466 --> 04:25:36,566
<b>Like when.</b>

507
04:25:38,100 --> 04:25:38,666
<b>But.</b>

508
04:25:41,666 --> 04:25:44,266
<b>Yeah. Yeah. I just had it connect there and I'm able to</b>

509
04:25:44,266 --> 04:25:46,700
<b>interact with the code base. You can submit like.</b>

510
04:25:48,166 --> 04:25:49,066
<b>Like shelf and stuff like that.</b>

511
04:25:50,100 --> 04:25:51,766
<b>So it's.</b>

512
04:25:52,100 --> 04:25:58,700
<b>But it's very available. It's very available. Yeah. It's</b>

513
04:25:58,700 --> 04:26:01,299
<b>rudimentary too. I don't think it can. It's nearly as</b>

514
04:26:01,299 --> 04:26:02,466
<b>capable of the stuff that you're</b>

515
04:26:02,466 --> 04:26:05,166
<b>talking about. So but it's it's.</b>

516
04:26:05,166 --> 04:26:07,066
<b>But it's available at a standalone</b>

517
04:26:07,066 --> 04:26:10,066
<b>software. Or is it just extension.</b>

518
04:26:10,133 --> 04:26:17,533
<b>I don't know. Yeah I'll check those things on a set. Yeah I</b>

519
04:26:17,533 --> 04:26:19,666
<b>don't want to take up too much of your time as well.</b>

520
04:26:21,066 --> 04:26:25,033
<b>Right. Yeah it seems like it can do.</b>

521
04:26:26,200 --> 04:26:26,666
<b>Okay.</b>

522
04:26:28,366 --> 04:26:31,333
<b>This is this looks like it's in the escrow.</b>

523
04:26:32,866 --> 04:26:33,399
<b>Mm hmm.</b>

524
04:26:35,600 --> 04:26:35,799
<b>Uh.</b>

525
04:26:36,866 --> 04:26:37,066
<b>I'm gonna say.</b>

526
04:26:37,266 --> 04:26:42,266
<b>Because if it's very subtle and you're already familiar</b>

527
04:26:42,266 --> 04:26:44,466
<b>with it they might as well play around with it.</b>

528
04:26:45,133 --> 04:26:45,333
<b>Like.</b>

529
04:26:47,000 --> 04:26:47,200
<b>Yeah.</b>

530
04:26:47,466 --> 04:26:49,966
<b>It gives you more flexibility. Yeah. Yeah.</b>

531
04:26:50,100 --> 04:26:50,533
<b>Oh and.</b>

532
04:26:52,133 --> 04:26:53,433
<b>I'll look into it.</b>

533
04:26:54,366 --> 04:26:54,566
<b>It's.</b>

534
04:26:55,766 --> 04:26:57,333
<b>So I found this one document.</b>

535
04:26:58,033 --> 04:26:59,666
<b>That's.</b>

536
04:27:00,133 --> 04:27:01,366
<b>This familiar to you it's</b>

537
04:27:01,366 --> 04:27:03,033
<b>called the Amazon queue developer.</b>

538
04:27:03,566 --> 04:27:04,100
<b>It's a.</b>

539
04:27:05,633 --> 04:27:06,000
<b>Yeah.</b>

540
04:27:06,100 --> 04:27:06,633
<b>I found.</b>

541
04:27:10,266 --> 04:27:10,433
<b>So.</b>

542
04:27:12,100 --> 04:27:12,666
<b>That's it right.</b>

543
04:27:14,166 --> 04:27:18,200
<b>So there is Amazon queue developer. Yeah yeah that's it.</b>

544
04:27:20,466 --> 04:27:21,833
<b>Yeah so there is a VSCode</b>

545
04:27:21,833 --> 04:27:24,066
<b>extension as well which is I think.</b>

546
04:27:25,100 --> 04:27:30,433
<b>Just referred to as queue dev I guess I'm not sure but then</b>

547
04:27:30,433 --> 04:27:34,200
<b>there's the queue CLI which is the one that sort of is more</b>

548
04:27:34,200 --> 04:27:39,066
<b>agentic like it's it's natively agentic.</b>

549
04:27:40,233 --> 04:27:41,866
<b>So the other one they added the</b>

550
04:27:41,866 --> 04:27:45,633
<b>agentic workflow afterwards like.</b>

551
04:27:47,033 --> 04:27:48,033
<b>So you can sort of tell the</b>

552
04:27:48,033 --> 04:27:49,066
<b>difference when you're running it from CLI.</b>

553
04:27:50,100 --> 04:27:52,933
<b>There's a very subtle difference on</b>

554
04:27:52,933 --> 04:27:55,966
<b>how they have access to workspaces.</b>

555
04:27:57,766 --> 04:27:58,766
<b>That's sort of.</b>

556
04:28:00,833 --> 04:28:04,733
<b>And also how they have access to your to your coding</b>

557
04:28:04,733 --> 04:28:08,066
<b>environment as well that makes it's a difference.</b>

558
04:28:11,100 --> 04:28:13,333
<b>You could try both and then</b>

559
04:28:13,333 --> 04:28:14,833
<b>you'll you'll sort of understand.</b>

560
04:28:16,100 --> 04:28:18,166
<b>Why one is better than the other.</b>

561
04:28:19,866 --> 04:28:22,399
<b>But this I guess this is just for the queue developer which</b>

562
04:28:22,399 --> 04:28:25,533
<b>is the backbone for for queue CLI as</b>

563
04:28:25,533 --> 04:28:28,000
<b>well as the queue VSCode extension.</b>

564
04:28:29,100 --> 04:28:29,633
<b>I see.</b>

565
04:28:31,100 --> 04:28:32,566
<b>That's interesting.</b>

566
04:28:33,133 --> 04:28:35,500
<b>I also found a mention that there's</b>

567
04:28:35,500 --> 04:28:37,000
<b>this little sub note in that link.</b>

568
04:28:38,933 --> 04:28:41,100
<b>Says that the queue CLI has become the key row.</b>

569
04:28:41,533 --> 04:28:44,100
<b>So do you think is that like a new name for it or am I.</b>

570
04:28:45,100 --> 04:28:48,266
<b>Misinterpreting what it's saying in the same document or</b>

571
04:28:48,266 --> 04:28:50,866
<b>yeah yeah I just sent a link to it.</b>

572
04:28:51,666 --> 04:28:54,066
<b>I looked up your CLI and.</b>

573
04:28:55,366 --> 04:28:57,133
<b>It looked it looks pretty</b>

574
04:28:57,133 --> 04:28:58,600
<b>similar to what you're talking about.</b>

575
04:29:00,066 --> 04:29:02,866
<b>So I'm hoping yeah yeah yeah something like that but.</b>

576
04:29:04,266 --> 04:29:04,966
<b>Let me see.</b>

577
04:29:08,366 --> 04:29:08,566
<b>Sorry.</b>

578
04:29:10,899 --> 04:29:11,066
<b>Here was the ally.</b>

579
04:29:11,133 --> 04:29:13,100
<b>Interesting.</b>

580
04:29:13,666 --> 04:29:15,000
<b>I've never heard of curious really.</b>

581
04:29:16,033 --> 04:29:20,266
<b>I already had it installed from two months ago actually so.</b>

582
04:29:21,433 --> 04:29:22,733
<b>Would be interesting if they.</b>

583
04:29:24,966 --> 04:29:26,933
<b>But I'm still running it as Q.</b>

584
04:29:27,966 --> 04:29:30,666
<b>So I mean that's that's strange.</b>

585
04:29:32,266 --> 04:29:33,366
<b>Let me see if I can.</b>

586
04:29:36,100 --> 04:29:38,333
<b>Let me see if I can find the</b>

587
04:29:38,333 --> 04:29:40,100
<b>link that I used to install it.</b>

588
04:29:41,133 --> 04:29:42,066
<b>Tell me.</b>

589
04:29:53,733 --> 04:29:53,966
<b>OK.</b>

590
04:29:57,766 --> 04:29:59,799
<b>Yeah OK yeah I'm using the same link</b>

591
04:29:59,799 --> 04:30:02,133
<b>and it's taking me to this cure thing.</b>

592
04:30:03,133 --> 04:30:04,133
<b>OK so it's just a rename.</b>

593
04:30:06,033 --> 04:30:08,533
<b>Maybe I haven't.</b>

594
04:30:08,533 --> 04:30:10,100
<b>I haven't tried this cure.</b>

595
04:30:11,333 --> 04:30:13,466
<b>Because it looks like a separate thing as well like.</b>

596
04:30:14,933 --> 04:30:16,200
<b>Like it has its own page and</b>

597
04:30:16,200 --> 04:30:19,366
<b>everything but it's not what I'm running but.</b>

598
04:30:23,333 --> 04:30:25,533
<b>I'll let you know.</b>

599
04:30:25,533 --> 04:30:25,566
<b>Yes.</b>

600
04:30:26,433 --> 04:30:26,566
<b>Yeah.</b>

601
04:30:29,700 --> 04:30:30,399
<b>Yeah I'm gonna.</b>

602
04:30:31,333 --> 04:30:31,533
<b>Yeah.</b>

603
04:30:32,566 --> 04:30:37,399
<b>Oh do you want to go over like what was covered in the</b>

604
04:30:37,399 --> 04:30:38,666
<b>meeting or anything like that.</b>

605
04:30:39,866 --> 04:30:40,066
<b>I did.</b>

606
04:30:40,100 --> 04:30:40,500
<b>I did.</b>

607
04:30:40,700 --> 04:30:41,366
<b>You are good.</b>

608
04:30:42,433 --> 04:30:43,066
<b>Yeah sorry.</b>

609
04:30:43,466 --> 04:30:43,899
<b>Yeah please.</b>

610
04:30:44,433 --> 04:30:45,633
<b>I'll just share with you the</b>

611
04:30:45,633 --> 04:30:48,433
<b>agenda I generated from the transcript.</b>

612
04:30:51,100 --> 04:30:51,233
<b>See.</b>

613
04:30:52,866 --> 04:30:53,633
<b>Sorry not the agenda.</b>

614
04:30:53,933 --> 04:30:59,366
<b>It was pretty good but we got</b>

615
04:30:59,366 --> 04:31:01,166
<b>stuck on that document that I sent you.</b>

616
04:31:02,233 --> 04:31:04,000
<b>Once we move past it we kind of just like</b>

617
04:31:04,000 --> 04:31:06,366
<b>acknowledged the documentation all needs.</b>

618
04:31:07,100 --> 04:31:07,766
<b>Organizational update.</b>

619
04:31:09,100 --> 04:31:11,666
<b>We're going to kind of figure out</b>

620
04:31:11,666 --> 04:31:14,666
<b>and fill our specific roles as a team.</b>

621
04:31:15,466 --> 04:31:17,466
<b>Just by speaking about what we.</b>

622
04:31:18,466 --> 04:31:23,366
<b>What kind of things we discover when the new teammates load</b>

623
04:31:23,366 --> 04:31:26,866
<b>and run the repository for the first time.</b>

624
04:31:27,433 --> 04:31:29,700
<b>Whether we come across any bugs when they do that because</b>

625
04:31:29,700 --> 04:31:32,066
<b>you know once find on my machine when there's 10.</b>

626
04:31:32,133 --> 04:31:33,066
<b>But.</b>

627
04:31:33,700 --> 04:31:38,366
<b>You know who knows how good it's going to run on different</b>

628
04:31:38,366 --> 04:31:40,166
<b>operating systems anything like that.</b>

629
04:31:40,166 --> 04:31:41,633
<b>I don't know.</b>

630
04:31:42,066 --> 04:31:43,333
<b>If I can find it here.</b>

631
04:31:44,833 --> 04:31:45,733
<b>Oh I'm in the wrong.</b>

632
04:31:46,833 --> 04:31:48,133
<b>I need to be on master.</b>

633
04:31:49,466 --> 04:31:52,033
<b>Get back to the logs.</b>

634
04:31:52,766 --> 04:31:53,066
<b>Here it is.</b>

635
04:31:53,133 --> 04:32:01,266
<b>Yeah so this is a summary of the</b>

636
04:32:01,266 --> 04:32:02,766
<b>transcript that I had generated.</b>

637
04:32:05,233 --> 04:32:12,466
<b>It basically just goes over a lot of what we just went over</b>

638
04:32:12,466 --> 04:32:14,233
<b>except you know for you you</b>

639
04:32:14,233 --> 04:32:15,066
<b>had some more specific questions.</b>

640
04:32:15,366 --> 04:32:23,533
<b>When it comes to the project planning I kind of just</b>

641
04:32:23,533 --> 04:32:26,466
<b>acknowledge that we have a lot of documentation it's</b>

642
04:32:26,466 --> 04:32:27,966
<b>scattered all over the place.</b>

643
04:32:30,766 --> 04:32:31,133
<b>Also.</b>

644
04:32:32,633 --> 04:32:36,066
<b>When it comes to this directory references at the bottom.</b>

645
04:32:37,066 --> 04:32:37,700
<b>There's also like.</b>

646
04:32:38,866 --> 04:32:41,066
<b>Some blind spots that we all kind of had.</b>

647
04:32:42,100 --> 04:32:47,066
<b>It really just about like technical complexity.</b>

648
04:32:48,200 --> 04:32:50,333
<b>Of the mathematic proposals for</b>

649
04:32:50,333 --> 04:32:53,033
<b>the contextual integrity score.</b>

650
04:32:53,766 --> 04:32:54,266
<b>I think I already.</b>

651
04:32:54,933 --> 04:32:55,600
<b>Over that.</b>

652
04:32:57,600 --> 04:32:57,733
<b>Okay.</b>

653
04:32:58,066 --> 04:32:58,733
<b>Samuel also.</b>

654
04:32:59,799 --> 04:33:00,600
<b>So Samuel he.</b>

655
04:33:02,233 --> 04:33:04,000
<b>I don't know if you've looked into him.</b>

656
04:33:04,266 --> 04:33:05,666
<b>I think I can share his LinkedIn.</b>

657
04:33:06,066 --> 04:33:12,566
<b>Oh I have a list of. I have a list of the team LinkedIn. Let me share that with you too.</b>

658
04:33:13,233 --> 04:33:14,033
<b>That's a good resource.</b>

659
04:33:17,299 --> 04:33:18,700
<b>Samuel brought up.</b>

660
04:33:19,099 --> 04:33:19,299
<b>The.</b>

661
04:33:20,799 --> 04:33:21,500
<b>Fact that.</b>

662
04:33:22,666 --> 04:33:23,366
<b>Wait a second.</b>

663
04:33:25,099 --> 04:33:26,566
<b>Yeah we need a reusable benchmark.</b>

664
04:33:27,166 --> 04:33:28,500
<b>I think you brought that up to you right.</b>

665
04:33:29,966 --> 04:33:33,066
<b>So here's.</b>

666
04:33:33,066 --> 04:33:33,366
<b>The. The. The. The.</b>

667
04:33:33,366 --> 04:33:33,400
<b>The. The. The. Yeah.</b>

668
04:33:33,400 --> 04:33:34,866
<b>So here's.</b>

669
04:33:36,566 --> 04:33:40,066
<b>Is everybody.</b>

670
04:33:42,466 --> 04:33:46,000
<b>Yeah I shared this with.</b>

671
04:33:46,466 --> 04:33:47,833
<b>Somebody else ahead of the meeting.</b>

672
04:34:03,133 --> 04:34:15,433
<b>Yeah, so the action items at the bottom,</b>

673
04:34:15,633 --> 04:34:18,566
<b>they kind of just tackle what we agreed to do.</b>

674
04:34:20,033 --> 04:34:21,733
<b>Everybody's going to install the dependencies.</b>

675
04:34:25,333 --> 04:34:28,666
<b>Familiarize themselves with the project structure, test out</b>

676
04:34:28,666 --> 04:34:29,966
<b>the project, try and get it running.</b>

677
04:34:31,299 --> 04:34:35,400
<b>And then there's the end vision</b>

678
04:34:35,400 --> 04:34:36,766
<b>that we have to talk about too.</b>

679
04:34:38,466 --> 04:34:41,766
<b>Yeah, because I think we have a lot</b>

680
04:34:41,766 --> 04:34:43,200
<b>of strong logic, but we don't have an</b>

681
04:34:43,333 --> 04:34:44,966
<b>envision of what it's going to look like.</b>

682
04:34:45,266 --> 04:34:50,266
<b>So that's a tough hurdle, I'll be honest.</b>

683
04:34:51,466 --> 04:34:52,633
<b>You know, I've never really done anything</b>

684
04:34:52,633 --> 04:34:54,900
<b>like this before. I just have this really</b>

685
04:34:55,466 --> 04:35:00,400
<b>ambitious idea that I've been working on for months. But</b>

686
04:35:00,400 --> 04:35:02,933
<b>we'll figure it out, we'll adapt.</b>

687
04:35:06,266 --> 04:35:08,900
<b>If you happen to know anybody</b>

688
04:35:08,900 --> 04:35:14,633
<b>who is pretty proficient in math,</b>

689
04:35:16,266 --> 04:35:19,566
<b>that would be a huge plus. I'm going to reach out to some</b>

690
04:35:19,566 --> 04:35:23,233
<b>professors and see if they can find</b>

691
04:35:23,266 --> 04:35:24,866
<b>anybody that would be willing to help us</b>

692
04:35:24,866 --> 04:35:27,933
<b>on this. Because as much as I want to trust</b>

693
04:35:28,633 --> 04:35:33,799
<b>prompting and doing AI-generated research to kind of revise</b>

694
04:35:33,799 --> 04:35:35,599
<b>all the mathematical logic behind it,</b>

695
04:35:36,033 --> 04:35:41,133
<b>I need a human to look at it. Because it's a wave of my</b>

696
04:35:41,133 --> 04:35:44,933
<b>understanding. It apparently has something</b>

697
04:35:44,933 --> 04:35:49,033
<b>to do with vector embeddings and graph theory. And yeah,</b>

698
04:35:49,033 --> 04:35:51,866
<b>it's up there. But I think the</b>

699
04:35:51,933 --> 04:35:55,233
<b>implementation itself should be relatively simple once we</b>

700
04:35:55,233 --> 04:35:57,633
<b>kind of reach a conclusion on that.</b>

701
04:36:00,233 --> 04:36:01,500
<b>I'll try to have a think. And if</b>

702
04:36:01,500 --> 04:36:04,566
<b>someone comes to mind, I'll let you know.</b>

703
04:36:05,833 --> 04:36:08,833
<b>That would be a huge plus. No</b>

704
04:36:08,833 --> 04:36:11,666
<b>pressure, though. Just if anybody happens.</b>

705
04:36:11,666 --> 04:36:14,099
<b>Yeah, I would have suggested my</b>

706
04:36:14,099 --> 04:36:16,233
<b>supervisors, but they're quite shit. To be honest,</b>

707
04:36:16,233 --> 04:36:17,099
<b>they're barely doing their</b>

708
04:36:17,099 --> 04:36:19,266
<b>jobs. I don't think they would be.</b>

709
04:36:21,900 --> 04:36:25,333
<b>I don't think they would. What do they specialize in?</b>

710
04:36:27,466 --> 04:36:32,233
<b>One of them specialized in computer vision. The other is</b>

711
04:36:32,233 --> 04:36:34,500
<b>specialized in fairness in AI,</b>

712
04:36:35,366 --> 04:36:39,700
<b>which is sort of a vague term for ethics-washing shit. Why</b>

713
04:36:39,700 --> 04:36:42,166
<b>am I saying this? It is what it is,</b>

714
04:36:42,166 --> 04:36:45,000
<b>I guess. That's sort of what the</b>

715
04:36:45,000 --> 04:36:46,599
<b>field is becoming into, to be honest.</b>

716
04:36:46,633 --> 04:36:52,299
<b>Really? Yeah, yeah. To slippery slope.</b>

717
04:36:57,566 --> 04:37:02,466
<b>That's crazy. Excuse me.</b>

718
04:37:04,433 --> 04:37:09,066
<b>I'm trying to think of anything else that</b>

719
04:37:09,066 --> 04:37:11,866
<b>I've covered. If you haven't checked out</b>

720
04:37:12,700 --> 04:37:17,566
<b>the website that's not the one that's public, but somebody,</b>

721
04:37:18,566 --> 04:37:20,299
<b>I think it was Samuel, he created a</b>

722
04:37:20,299 --> 04:37:24,966
<b>website in the onboarding folder that you can find in the</b>

723
04:37:24,966 --> 04:37:29,933
<b>new folder. I'll send you a file path</b>

724
04:37:29,933 --> 04:37:34,666
<b>to that. So if you pull the master branch, you can go to</b>

725
04:37:34,666 --> 04:37:37,033
<b>this file path, open it in your browser,</b>

726
04:37:37,900 --> 04:37:41,799
<b>and it gives you a good navigate. It's just a good link to</b>

727
04:37:41,799 --> 04:37:44,099
<b>have. I'm building off of that today,</b>

728
04:37:44,099 --> 04:37:48,766
<b>so I'm going to build file trees, and I'm going to</b>

729
04:37:48,766 --> 04:37:50,933
<b>incorporate that into this kind of website.</b>

730
04:37:52,266 --> 04:37:54,566
<b>Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to optimize the</b>

731
04:37:54,566 --> 04:37:57,066
<b>documentation in the way that the files are</b>

732
04:37:57,066 --> 04:38:01,266
<b>organized so that everything is much more understandable.</b>

733
04:38:01,266 --> 04:38:02,933
<b>There's no confusing documentation</b>

734
04:38:03,266 --> 04:38:07,366
<b>that pulls you away from the main plans. What I'm going to</b>

735
04:38:07,366 --> 04:38:09,099
<b>do is I'm going to consolidate the plans</b>

736
04:38:10,233 --> 04:38:12,333
<b>into a more rigorous planning document</b>

737
04:38:12,333 --> 04:38:16,099
<b>than the most recent one, which was made</b>

738
04:38:17,900 --> 04:38:23,366
<b>over a week ago, so it's time for an update. Then I think</b>

739
04:38:23,366 --> 04:38:25,666
<b>after that, we'll be able to look at that</b>

740
04:38:25,666 --> 04:38:30,733
<b>plan and incorporate the Envision into that and see where</b>

741
04:38:30,733 --> 04:38:33,000
<b>everything fits in, especially in regards</b>

742
04:38:33,033 --> 04:38:37,400
<b>to your questions about all those specifics. I'm hoping we</b>

743
04:38:37,400 --> 04:38:38,900
<b>have enough of a foundation where</b>

744
04:38:39,266 --> 04:38:42,466
<b>that kind of stuff can just easily fall into place, while</b>

745
04:38:42,466 --> 04:38:44,866
<b>we can keep in mind all of the</b>

746
04:38:44,866 --> 04:38:48,566
<b>documentation on how the competition is structured and what</b>

747
04:38:48,566 --> 04:38:50,099
<b>the judges would be expecting to.</b>

748
04:38:51,200 --> 04:38:54,233
<b>So it should just be a good balance between research and</b>

749
04:38:54,233 --> 04:38:56,633
<b>discovery, active foundational plans,</b>

750
04:38:57,266 --> 04:39:01,333
<b>and judge expectations. That should be the golden triad for</b>

751
04:39:01,333 --> 04:39:03,866
<b>our next week here. I'm going to do my</b>

752
04:39:03,866 --> 04:39:07,599
<b>best to make sure that the organization is good enough for</b>

753
04:39:07,599 --> 04:39:11,666
<b>people to easily understand that</b>

754
04:39:12,366 --> 04:39:17,466
<b>and contribute to it. I hope that's helpful.</b>

755
04:39:18,466 --> 04:39:22,033
<b>Yeah, and I think you're doing a good job, honestly.</b>

756
04:39:23,233 --> 04:39:27,000
<b>Yeah, in terms of organization.</b>

757
04:39:28,833 --> 04:39:31,866
<b>It's getting there. It's kind of all over the place right</b>

758
04:39:31,866 --> 04:39:33,333
<b>now, but at least everything's in</b>

759
04:39:33,733 --> 04:39:36,266
<b>an appropriate folder so far, and everything is a</b>

760
04:39:36,266 --> 04:39:41,200
<b>timestamp. We haven't accumulated too</b>

761
04:39:41,200 --> 04:39:44,066
<b>much contextual debt, although we have accumulated some.</b>

762
04:39:44,900 --> 04:39:45,799
<b>There's always going to be that.</b>

763
04:39:47,166 --> 04:39:50,666
<b>It's just something. But yeah, I don't know. I've kind of</b>

764
04:39:50,666 --> 04:39:52,566
<b>felt a lot of imposter syndrome about this</b>

765
04:39:52,566 --> 04:39:55,233
<b>because I don't even have a college degree or anything like</b>

766
04:39:55,233 --> 04:40:01,433
<b>that. It's been a little bit scary</b>

767
04:40:01,433 --> 04:40:04,566
<b>this past week preparing to have people that are writing</b>

768
04:40:04,566 --> 04:40:07,266
<b>PhD dissertations and stuff and take a</b>

769
04:40:07,266 --> 04:40:11,000
<b>look at this project. Part of being</b>

770
04:40:11,000 --> 04:40:14,533
<b>expected to be like, "You're crazy. There's no</b>

771
04:40:15,433 --> 04:40:18,000
<b>coherent thought in this repository. It's just a bunch of</b>

772
04:40:18,000 --> 04:40:21,266
<b>mumbo-jumbo." But I think I've hopefully</b>

773
04:40:21,900 --> 04:40:25,866
<b>kind of phased past that. I don't know if you've looked at</b>

774
04:40:25,866 --> 04:40:28,366
<b>the branch history of this repository,</b>

775
04:40:28,633 --> 04:40:30,599
<b>but it started out as a</b>

776
04:40:30,599 --> 04:40:37,333
<b>note-taking app. So it's come a long way.</b>

777
04:40:37,333 --> 04:40:43,500
<b>It's come a long way. I don't want to keep you for too</b>

778
04:40:43,500 --> 04:40:45,533
<b>long. It's been about an hour, but</b>

779
04:40:46,633 --> 04:40:48,666
<b>yeah. No, I'm okay. You probably</b>

780
04:40:48,666 --> 04:40:50,533
<b>want to go sleep as well at this point.</b>

781
04:40:51,733 --> 04:40:55,233
<b>Honestly losing a little bit. But hey, I'm glad we'll catch</b>

782
04:40:55,233 --> 04:40:58,599
<b>up. I would really appreciate it if you</b>

783
04:40:58,633 --> 04:41:09,666
<b>connected with Garrett and kind of just reached out to him,</b>

784
04:41:09,666 --> 04:41:12,233
<b>either in the server or gave him the</b>

785
04:41:12,233 --> 04:41:18,066
<b>DM or something. Yeah. Because yeah, who knows where he's</b>

786
04:41:18,066 --> 04:41:19,566
<b>in Germany, but that would be really</b>

787
04:41:19,566 --> 04:41:23,766
<b>clutch if you guys could meet at the same time and kind of</b>

788
04:41:23,766 --> 04:41:25,866
<b>see if you guys would be a good pair.</b>

789
04:41:25,866 --> 04:41:30,166
<b>Yeah. Because we talked about the way that we're doing this. We're doing this in Germany. Yeah. Yeah. Because we talked about meeting asynchronously.</b>

790
04:41:31,799 --> 04:41:33,299
<b>It's going to be difficult to</b>

791
04:41:33,299 --> 04:41:37,766
<b>get everybody to meet at the same time. There's somebody in</b>

792
04:41:37,766 --> 04:41:39,599
<b>Singapore. There's somebody in each</b>

793
04:41:39,599 --> 04:41:44,200
<b>time zone in the US. But yeah, I just want</b>

794
04:41:44,200 --> 04:41:45,466
<b>to say, yeah, thanks for meeting with me.</b>

795
04:41:53,866 --> 04:41:58,466
<b>Yeah. Check out the index webpage when you have time. And</b>

796
04:41:58,466 --> 04:42:00,466
<b>yeah, I'll be adding on to that.</b>

797
04:42:01,566 --> 04:42:06,766
<b>Awesome. And also don't try to give me</b>

798
04:42:06,766 --> 04:42:09,633
<b>some action points. Actually, that'd be</b>

799
04:42:10,466 --> 04:42:11,733
<b>better for me. Like if you</b>

800
04:42:11,733 --> 04:42:14,099
<b>could be like, do this and do that.</b>

801
04:42:15,333 --> 04:42:20,133
<b>Sweet. So yeah, honestly, the questions that you asked me,</b>

802
04:42:20,433 --> 04:42:23,566
<b>I think it would be really good if you</b>

803
04:42:23,566 --> 04:42:27,266
<b>could come up with some big picture ideas, you know, from a</b>

804
04:42:27,266 --> 04:42:28,500
<b>bird's eye view. You don't have to</b>

805
04:42:28,500 --> 04:42:31,966
<b>get into the details. But if you could figure out what the</b>

806
04:42:31,966 --> 04:42:33,966
<b>judges are going to be expecting from</b>

807
04:42:33,966 --> 04:42:36,966
<b>this competition and try to come up with a</b>

808
04:42:36,966 --> 04:42:42,466
<b>general, just a general idea of the kind of</b>

809
04:42:42,466 --> 04:42:47,133
<b>submission structure and evaluation. Yeah. So, you know,</b>

810
04:42:47,133 --> 04:42:48,666
<b>you can take a look at the A2A protocol</b>

811
04:42:48,666 --> 04:42:52,366
<b>that they use. I don't know if Auth0, you know, that</b>

812
04:42:52,366 --> 04:42:54,633
<b>company that has a sponsorship, we're going</b>

813
04:42:54,633 --> 04:42:56,900
<b>to, I don't know if that's going to have anything to do</b>

814
04:42:56,900 --> 04:42:58,666
<b>with it. That would be extremely helpful.</b>

815
04:42:59,566 --> 04:43:05,566
<b>Also, if you could just, I'm going to</b>

816
04:43:05,566 --> 04:43:07,266
<b>take your questions that you already sent me,</b>

817
04:43:07,500 --> 04:43:11,033
<b>but if you have any more, feel free to just keep popping</b>

818
04:43:11,033 --> 04:43:12,733
<b>questions into the questions channel,</b>

819
04:43:13,233 --> 04:43:16,033
<b>because we need to figure out what we don't know right now.</b>

820
04:43:16,966 --> 04:43:18,533
<b>It's important to ask those questions.</b>

821
04:43:20,000 --> 04:43:23,166
<b>But yeah, if you could just try and, you know, take a look</b>

822
04:43:23,166 --> 04:43:24,366
<b>at the code, come up with some like,</b>

823
04:43:24,366 --> 04:43:30,666
<b>you know, high level answers and then put into the ideas</b>

824
04:43:30,666 --> 04:43:33,133
<b>channel for now. So, you know, just really</b>

825
04:43:33,133 --> 04:43:36,733
<b>casual for now. And then we can start to create some proper</b>

826
04:43:36,733 --> 04:43:38,366
<b>documentation structure for this</b>

827
04:43:39,166 --> 04:43:43,200
<b>and figure out like a planning and corporation pipeline,</b>

828
04:43:43,200 --> 04:43:44,799
<b>right? Because there's this pattern</b>

829
04:43:44,799 --> 04:43:47,166
<b>that we're going to constantly undergo. We're going to have</b>

830
04:43:47,166 --> 04:43:49,233
<b>a plan, a planning document that</b>

831
04:43:49,266 --> 04:43:52,666
<b>overscores like the large scope of the plan. We'll probably</b>

832
04:43:52,666 --> 04:43:54,266
<b>create individual planning documents</b>

833
04:43:54,266 --> 04:43:56,566
<b>from that. And at the same time, we'll probably have a</b>

834
04:43:56,566 --> 04:43:58,366
<b>pipeline of all these questions and ideas</b>

835
04:43:58,366 --> 04:44:01,066
<b>that we need to feed into the plan and revise accordingly.</b>

836
04:44:01,599 --> 04:44:04,799
<b>So that's something that I'm going</b>

837
04:44:04,799 --> 04:44:07,066
<b>to try and help figure out too. But if you have any ideas</b>

838
04:44:07,066 --> 04:44:10,700
<b>of like that specifically, how the</b>

839
04:44:10,700 --> 04:44:14,433
<b>planning aspect of this project could be better improved,</b>

840
04:44:14,433 --> 04:44:16,766
<b>anything at all, that would be helpful</b>

841
04:44:16,866 --> 04:44:19,533
<b>too. I'm not expecting you to do that, but if you have any</b>

842
04:44:19,533 --> 04:44:23,299
<b>ideas for that. Yeah, I'll keep that in</b>

843
04:44:23,299 --> 04:44:28,299
<b>mind. So there's that, there is a reach out to Ger as well.</b>

844
04:44:29,900 --> 04:44:32,133
<b>And then I'll try to find someone</b>

845
04:44:33,500 --> 04:44:36,766
<b>that might be able to help us with the math. I'll have a</b>

846
04:44:36,766 --> 04:44:39,166
<b>look at the documents on me as well.</b>

847
04:44:39,633 --> 04:44:44,333
<b>Thank you so much. And yeah, no worries. I'm not like, I'm</b>

848
04:44:44,333 --> 04:44:45,666
<b>not going to over expect anything</b>

849
04:44:46,400 --> 04:44:49,133
<b>from you, but I just, you know, I appreciate your effort</b>

850
04:44:49,133 --> 04:44:51,433
<b>and I'm really happy that you were able to</b>

851
04:44:51,566 --> 04:44:55,433
<b>join the team. I just, yeah, I'm</b>

852
04:44:55,433 --> 04:44:58,200
<b>really grateful. Yeah, I'm happy to be here.</b>

853
04:45:00,233 --> 04:45:03,700
<b>Sweet man. All right. Well, I'm going to let you go on and</b>

854
04:45:03,700 --> 04:45:07,366
<b>yeah, just we'll catch up later. Hopefully,</b>

855
04:45:09,033 --> 04:45:11,466
<b>I don't know, we'll figure out we're still working on call</b>

856
04:45:11,466 --> 04:45:13,066
<b>scheduling and all that. But yeah,</b>

857
04:45:13,099 --> 04:45:15,466
<b>I'll see you in the dashboard chat and stuff. And I'll let</b>

858
04:45:15,466 --> 04:45:16,466
<b>you know if I have any updates.</b>

859
04:45:17,966 --> 04:45:21,066
<b>All right. Sounds good. Take care. Bye-bye.</b>
