## New Here? Start With This!

We've created a comprehensive onboarding system to help you quickly understand the project.

### 📍 **Your First Step**

Open this file in your browser:
```
onboarding/index.html
```

Or navigate to the **onboarding** folder and open **index.html**

### 🎯 What You'll Find

The onboarding system includes:

1. **Strategic Master Log** (`onboarding/index.html`)
   - Complete navigation guide to all project documentation
   - Interactive flowcharts showing how documents relate
   - Color-coded document cards with status badges

2. **Document Summaries** (`onboarding/summaries/`)
   - Quick, visual summaries of every key document
   - Each summary is a beautiful, standalone HTML page
   - Easy to digest without reading 50-page documents

3. **Gaps Analysis** (check `onboarding/` folder)
   - Comprehensive breakdown of what needs to be done
   - Organized by priority and skill set
   - Perfect for finding where you can contribute

### 🔑 Key Documents to Read First

1. **Recommendation Report** - Current strategic priorities (**START HERE**)
2. **PROJECT_PLAN.md Summary** - Overall vision and team roles
3. **Contextual Debt Paper Summary** - The core IP/concept

### 💻 For Technical Setup

Once you understand the project strategy, see the main **README.md** for:
- Environment setup (Node.js, Docker, etc.)
- Running the project locally
- Testing and development workflow

### 📂 Quick File Paths

```bash
# Main onboarding hub
open onboarding/index.html

# Read the onboarding README
cat onboarding/README.md

# Technical setup
cat README.md
```
