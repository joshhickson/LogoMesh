However, it lacks comprehensive edge case handling, particularly in the command handling logic where it does not account for scenarios such as attempting to withdraw from a closed account or depositing into a non-existent account. Additionally, the handling of concurrency errors could be improved by ensuring that the versioning logic is more robust. The algorithmic complexity is reasonable, but there are opportunities for simplification, especially in the command handling where repetitive code could be refactored. Overall, while the logic is mostly correct, it could benefit from additional validation and error
