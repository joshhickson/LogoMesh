2 0 2 5 1 1 1 2 3 big plan overarching themes step one connect current log summary in logs slash technical slash Josh dash temp to the root onboarding folder which contains a simple web server which contains simple graph theory documentation that has not been completely implemented I believe that this is the proper foundation that the big brain plan should be built upon because it already has some simple UI for the teams to navigate so it will be easier for them to adapt using this it has to be addressed how simple we can hold the visualization because the main priority is the logic within connecting the document nodes to each other and having that document tree data so that we can efficiently figure out how to reorganize the documents the UI comes second we don't have to do anything crazy with graph data UI anything like that ideally it would be some kind of barely adjustable graph view where you can just click on the nodes and open a link in a new tab of your browser to view the individual documents as simple web pages or in markdown format so we don't need any like HTML converts for every single file we can just link to it in markdown hopefully but I'm not sure one unanswered question is whether or not the simple web server for the onboarding directory can pull files from the logs or the docs directory so that question has to be answered another question that has to be answered is what kind of graphing UI modules are we currently using in order to display the connected nodes and then when it comes to the actual documentation implementation and consolidation plan with file name revisions how are we going to get the information from A to B so how are we going to get the data on the current documents and the links between the documents and what you know documents are referenced within those documents how are we going to get that and use a program to use that to effectively rename all the documentation to keep the links appropriate even when the file path directories have changed because you know that may not change what document connects to another document but it will change what directory or file path each document is going to be in so that's going to be like the most important part of the plan because every link still has to be it still has to be like a hardened link I don't want that link to be lost because a lot of the plans rely on that information especially when you feed a single document into an LLM and tell it to refer to the documents referenced within that document so those links are very important to me personally you know high level overarching plan we're basically just trying to identify all the known links potentially potentially add links to existing documentation to help better identify how these docs communicate with each other because a lot of documents they mention other documents but they don't mention them with a full file path name they just mention it with like oh it's the strategy plan or oh it's the recovery plan but they don't mention like the entire file path so that's those are technically I'm going to call those like broken links or unincorporated links within each document so that has to be updated to the plan another thing okay another another thing that has to be realized is so that's we're done with like the big brain document revision and consolidation plan right now another thing that needs to be addressed within the Logomesh project is the fact that you know the team the teammates have asked questions that I don't have answers for such as for you know like envision of the green agent how does the green agent operate in the sense that it evaluates purple agents from a high level what kind of rubric does it follow other than the contextual integrity score I'm going to pause recording okay I'm resuming the recording now so I may have lost a bit of personal short-term memory I'm taking a walk right now so don't include that in the plan so continuing off from like unanswered questions I talked about how the green agent evaluates the purple agent okay so one term that's being thrown around a lot in the current strategies and plans is the cyber sentinel agent and yeah like that's a cool term and I feel like it's defined mostly in the in the core IP documents and the document revisions so like the contextual debt research papers and all that that's going to be in the docs subfolder but there's no I don't think any high level overarching plan or summary plan such as the 20251113 dash recovery dash plan dot md in the log slash technical subfolder I don't think that talks about the cyber security agent at all so that has to do with that so it's okay that these questions are left unanswered but the reason why I'm bringing this up is that once we consolidate all the documents and you know revise the file names and all of that we're going to have to approach creating a better plan than logs slash technical slash 20251113 dash recovery dash plan dot md because that plan as good as it may be and as much as it has helped us begin the recovery process it's not nearly as good as a plan as I wish it could be and the main reason that I need to figure out for the why behind this plan is how is it going to address unanswered questions that we don't have time to answer yet and in terms of the end mission and vision for the green agent how are we going to document our revision of what the agent is going to look like inside of the agent beats software developer kit repository structure that we have to constrain it to because you know it's acknowledging the agent to agent protocol it's acknowledging Auth0 but it's not acknowledging it's not it may not acknowledge how the developers or the competition judges are going to use it and I know that some of the documentation out there does but it's not consolidated so yeah that has to be addressed and full stop okay and as the and you
