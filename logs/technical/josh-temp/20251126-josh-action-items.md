# Josh's Action Items (Consolidated 2025-11-26)

This document lists the specific action items assigned to Josh, consolidated from the team feedback analysis log.

### Collaboration & Tooling
- [ ] Create a dedicated folder in Google Docs for project deliverables, starting with the "Contextual Debt Paper."

### Benchmark Strategy & Competition
- [ ] Plan a research task to investigate existing benchmarks and assess their suitability for compilation or adaptation.
- [ ] Investigate benchmark size requirements, with the intention of asking in the MOOC Discord if official documentation is unclear.

### Task Assignments & Role Clarifications
- [ ] Identify a suitable person (potentially "Garrett") for implementation tasks that were previously assigned to Alaa.

### Research & Intellectual Property
- [ ] Use Google Scholar Labs AI (Gemini integration) to perform a literature search for papers similar to the project's. The goal is to clearly identify and articulate the unique contributions of the CIS.
