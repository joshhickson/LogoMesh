This is the first test of the Sony I don't fucking know what kind of recorder this is I forgot the model number But I'm in my car And I got the music turned up a little bit Just to see if I can do noise isolation And just like vocal isolation See if I can convert this audio to a transcript Even though there's music playing in the background Yeah, we'll see if the lyrics kind of get picked up too So, but yeah It's just an initial recording And it's recording at 48 kHz Or whatever you call it Kilobits 48 kilobits So it's the lowest setting It's in mono I have auto I have like auto noise gain stuff turned on And stuff like that So
