1
02:05:04,333 --> 02:05:05,633
<b>on the cyber fiscal system.</b>

2
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:12,266
<b>Yeah, so yeah, I don't know if that's enough for you</b>

3
02:05:12,733 --> 02:05:13,533
<b>or you want me to do.</b>

4
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:14,666
<b>(laughing)</b>

5
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,533
<b>It's okay, I think we can table that for another time.</b>

6
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:19,899
<b>Yeah, that's it.</b>

7
02:05:22,733 --> 02:05:25,233
<b>Who wants to go next?</b>

8
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:27,000
<b>Would you like to go ahead, Garett?</b>

9
02:05:28,566 --> 02:05:30,466
<b>Yeah, yeah, I can go ahead, yeah.</b>

10
02:05:30,766 --> 02:05:31,866
<b>So my name is Garett.</b>

11
02:05:32,699 --> 02:05:38,699
<b>I'm actually now living in Germany, so near Frankfurt.</b>

12
02:05:39,933 --> 02:05:42,233
<b>So it's kind of midnight, so I just woke up.</b>

13
02:05:43,566 --> 02:05:47,033
<b>So it's like 3 a.m. in the morning now.</b>

14
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:53,699
<b>I work as a AI engineer in a company already for a while</b>

15
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:57,800
<b>before I studied master in computer science,</b>

16
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:58,533
<b>focused in AI.</b>

17
02:05:59,533 --> 02:06:04,100
<b>And my work is now mainly focusing on multi-agent system</b>

18
02:06:04,899 --> 02:06:09,933
<b>that to build some productive AI or agent AI system</b>

19
02:06:10,933 --> 02:06:12,300
<b>for the company.</b>

20
02:06:12,866 --> 02:06:17,399
<b>So basically, for research part, I did relatively less.</b>

21
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:22,399
<b>I mostly attend the online courses like this Berkeley MOC,</b>

22
02:06:23,233 --> 02:06:27,733
<b>and then also from my job, a little bit research.</b>

23
02:06:28,233 --> 02:06:32,433
<b>But mainly, I, yeah, so learn AI from work</b>

24
02:06:32,933 --> 02:06:36,199
<b>and also like, yeah, by myself, so yeah.</b>

25
02:06:37,133 --> 02:06:40,300
<b>Sorry if I may add a few things which might be helpful.</b>

26
02:06:41,366 --> 02:06:42,600
<b>Being part of the team.</b>

27
02:06:43,399 --> 02:06:46,133
<b>Yeah, so I am a bit behind with AI</b>

28
02:06:46,333 --> 02:06:50,100
<b>after not doing something for almost two years now.</b>

29
02:06:51,133 --> 02:06:54,966
<b>And I mostly do research now.</b>

30
02:06:56,333 --> 02:06:58,899
<b>So why I joined the hackathon is because</b>

31
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:00,533
<b>I would love to do an internship</b>

32
02:07:00,933 --> 02:07:04,000
<b>and I need to do some dirty</b>

33
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,566
<b>works with some coding and stuff.</b>

34
02:07:07,833 --> 02:07:11,233
<b>Yeah, I've never done a hackathon before.</b>

35
02:07:11,233 --> 02:07:13,199
<b>It's a dream experience.</b>

36
02:07:14,133 --> 02:07:15,899
<b>Yeah, I could have out.</b>

37
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:22,300
<b>Yeah, I mean, for me, it's kind of similar.</b>

38
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:26,633
<b>I mean, not really looking kind for a job,</b>

39
02:07:26,633 --> 02:07:28,933
<b>but I think for like joining this hackathon for me,</b>

40
02:07:29,366 --> 02:07:34,866
<b>I would be more like understanding the AI</b>

41
02:07:35,266 --> 02:07:37,033
<b>or agent AI from the market.</b>

42
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:39,699
<b>So not just what I'm doing from the company,</b>

43
02:07:40,433 --> 02:07:43,533
<b>but also like, because I'm also in touch</b>

44
02:07:43,733 --> 02:07:46,699
<b>with different framework, I think it's also good</b>

45
02:07:47,233 --> 02:07:50,399
<b>that to work on the topic that are like</b>

46
02:07:50,866 --> 02:07:53,600
<b>from the research parts or from the outside.</b>

47
02:07:58,399 --> 02:08:03,433
<b>I guess I'll go next.</b>

48
02:08:04,233 --> 02:08:05,733
<b>Deepi, if you want, you can go after me.</b>

49
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,633
<b>So, oh, would you?</b>

50
02:08:10,766 --> 02:08:12,899
<b>Oh, you want me to go now?</b>

51
02:08:13,833 --> 02:08:16,033
<b>If you want, where I can go to.</b>

52
02:08:17,133 --> 02:08:18,699
<b>Okay, yes, that is fine.</b>

53
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,666
<b>You can go first and I can.</b>

54
02:08:22,100 --> 02:08:24,000
<b>Okay, yeah, so I'm Josh.</b>

55
02:08:26,366 --> 02:08:28,066
<b>Obviously I came up with like this repository</b>

56
02:08:28,333 --> 02:08:31,433
<b>and this crazy idea, but I'll be honest guys,</b>

57
02:08:31,733 --> 02:08:33,033
<b>like I've only gotten into</b>

58
02:08:33,033 --> 02:08:35,033
<b>like a genetic AI machine learning</b>

59
02:08:35,433 --> 02:08:38,333
<b>data science, computer science this year.</b>

60
02:08:39,133 --> 02:08:45,100
<b>So I'm kind of like, sorry,</b>

61
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:46,733
<b>I feel like I'm stuttering a lot.</b>

62
02:08:47,633 --> 02:08:49,100
<b>Admittedly, I'm actually very nervous</b>

63
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:52,066
<b>because although like I have this very ambitious idea,</b>

64
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
<b>I'm actually the least knowledgeable person here.</b>

65
02:08:55,533 --> 02:08:58,199
<b>I don't have a degree, I'm still in community college.</b>

66
02:08:58,433 --> 02:08:59,533
<b>I'm getting a degree in cinema.</b>

67
02:08:59,899 --> 02:09:02,233
<b>I'm not getting a degree in data science</b>

68
02:09:02,233 --> 02:09:02,866
<b>and machine learning.</b>

69
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:05,833
<b>I only got into AI because I was trying to write a book</b>

70
02:09:06,133 --> 02:09:08,000
<b>and use AI to organize my book,</b>

71
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,600
<b>but because the plot was so extensive and complicated,</b>

72
02:09:11,399 --> 02:09:14,633
<b>the context windows of the AI were too short.</b>

73
02:09:14,633 --> 02:09:16,366
<b>So I started learning about how AI worked</b>

74
02:09:17,133 --> 02:09:18,966
<b>and I started figuring out like, okay,</b>

75
02:09:18,966 --> 02:09:20,300
<b>well, what is a context window?</b>

76
02:09:23,033 --> 02:09:25,300
<b>How do prompting work?</b>

77
02:09:25,733 --> 02:09:28,500
<b>Like basically like what happens when you take a text</b>

78
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:30,199
<b>and you put it into a vector embedding?</b>

79
02:09:30,433 --> 02:09:34,066
<b>And how do you do that with like document manipulation</b>

80
02:09:34,366 --> 02:09:35,033
<b>and stuff like that?</b>

81
02:09:35,033 --> 02:09:36,199
<b>So I started getting into like GitHub</b>

82
02:09:36,199 --> 02:09:38,600
<b>and like agent AI coding and all that.</b>

83
02:09:39,233 --> 02:09:40,833
<b>And I started coming up with this idea</b>

84
02:09:40,833 --> 02:09:43,800
<b>for just a note taking app that would take your notes,</b>

85
02:09:44,866 --> 02:09:47,733
<b>assign JSON strings and stuff to each note</b>

86
02:09:48,199 --> 02:09:49,899
<b>and try to contextualize the note</b>

87
02:09:50,033 --> 02:09:52,800
<b>and embed it in a vector graph database</b>

88
02:09:53,133 --> 02:09:55,699
<b>and kind of do like a hybrid sort of thing</b>

89
02:09:55,833 --> 02:09:59,233
<b>where you can do just vector embeddings and translations</b>

90
02:09:59,433 --> 02:10:00,566
<b>within your own personal notes</b>

91
02:10:01,033 --> 02:10:02,899
<b>and then export those into JSON strings.</b>

92
02:10:02,899 --> 02:10:07,199
<b>And then kind of like a combination between like Neo4j,</b>

93
02:10:07,533 --> 02:10:09,833
<b>Obsidian, maybe a little bit of Figma.</b>

94
02:10:10,466 --> 02:10:15,633
<b>And then there's one more I'm kind of missing out on.</b>

95
02:10:15,633 --> 02:10:16,800
<b>Oh, Notion too, right?</b>

96
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:18,100
<b>Because we all know those.</b>

97
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:20,733
<b>Anyway, I tried to start creating the app.</b>

98
02:10:21,133 --> 02:10:22,966
<b>I called it LogoMesh, it failed</b>

99
02:10:23,133 --> 02:10:25,233
<b>because I was using AI to code the app</b>

100
02:10:25,233 --> 02:10:27,600
<b>and I had accumulated so much contextual debt,</b>

101
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:28,333
<b>which is like, you know,</b>

102
02:10:28,333 --> 02:10:29,666
<b>a combination of like technical debt</b>

103
02:10:30,133 --> 02:10:31,966
<b>and the why behind the code, not just the what,</b>

104
02:10:32,899 --> 02:10:35,933
<b>that it was just completely demented code.</b>

105
02:10:35,933 --> 02:10:37,399
<b>It was just completely embarrassing.</b>

106
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:39,100
<b>If you go back into the repository</b>

107
02:10:40,133 --> 02:10:42,500
<b>that I've given you access to, you'll find that.</b>

108
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:44,033
<b>You will find that app, you</b>

109
02:10:44,033 --> 02:10:45,233
<b>will find all of those branches.</b>

110
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:49,633
<b>And it kind of just led me to take a break</b>

111
02:10:49,633 --> 02:10:50,966
<b>from just trying to build an app</b>

112
02:10:50,966 --> 02:10:54,066
<b>and I just began to try and understand like what AI was</b>

113
02:10:54,066 --> 02:10:57,133
<b>and try to define a term for what I kept discovering</b>

114
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:59,399
<b>in my own personal projects as a consumer.</b>

115
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,366
<b>And that's what led me to kind of just unofficially</b>

116
02:11:02,366 --> 02:11:03,833
<b>coined the term contextual debt.</b>

117
02:11:04,566 --> 02:11:06,933
<b>And it's not until like the past two months</b>

118
02:11:07,233 --> 02:11:10,166
<b>that I had done research, I had decided,</b>

119
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:12,399
<b>okay, well, what if we evaluate it?</b>

120
02:11:12,399 --> 02:11:15,666
<b>What if we try to avoid it in some way?</b>

121
02:11:15,666 --> 02:11:19,233
<b>And I discovered this agentic AI competition</b>

122
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:20,899
<b>because I had started a data science club</b>

123
02:11:20,899 --> 02:11:21,899
<b>at my community college.</b>

124
02:11:22,866 --> 02:11:25,633
<b>So my faculty advisor brought that to me.</b>

125
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:27,233
<b>And I was like, well, you know what?</b>

126
02:11:27,233 --> 02:11:29,233
<b>This competition would be like the perfect way</b>

127
02:11:29,233 --> 02:11:32,199
<b>for me to try and complete this project in the first place</b>

128
02:11:32,199 --> 02:11:35,233
<b>because if I reshaped it to fit the guidelines</b>

129
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:37,266
<b>of the competition, then it gives me structure</b>

130
02:11:37,266 --> 02:11:38,166
<b>that I can work with.</b>

131
02:11:38,166 --> 02:11:39,800
<b>It gives me deadlines that I can work with.</b>

132
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,500
<b>And maybe I can try and create something tangible</b>

133
02:11:42,699 --> 02:11:45,033
<b>and find people that are interested in the same thing.</b>

134
02:11:45,633 --> 02:11:50,033
<b>And I may not be able to understand everything</b>

135
02:11:50,033 --> 02:11:52,000
<b>that's going on, but I've gotten a lot better</b>

136
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,766
<b>at managing GitHub repositories and planning</b>

137
02:11:54,766 --> 02:11:57,233
<b>and documentation and making sure that the code actually</b>

138
02:11:57,333 --> 02:11:58,966
<b>aligns with the research.</b>

139
02:11:59,733 --> 02:12:01,633
<b>So in that kind of way, I've kind of found my strength,</b>

140
02:12:02,633 --> 02:12:05,733
<b>but I have to be honest with you guys.</b>

141
02:12:05,733 --> 02:12:08,566
<b>A lot of times you guys are going to speak a lot</b>

142
02:12:08,566 --> 02:12:10,699
<b>of languages that I'm not going to understand.</b>

143
02:12:10,699 --> 02:12:11,899
<b>You're gonna throw a lot of terms around</b>

144
02:12:11,899 --> 02:12:12,899
<b>that I'm not gonna understand.</b>

145
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:16,500
<b>And I'm gonna have to come back later to like,</b>

146
02:12:16,866 --> 02:12:19,500
<b>transcriptive recordings of it and kind of have things</b>

147
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:20,833
<b>explained to me.</b>

148
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:22,899
<b>That doesn't mean that I'm not capable</b>

149
02:12:23,233 --> 02:12:24,733
<b>in like managing this project.</b>

150
02:12:24,733 --> 02:12:26,033
<b>I'm going to do my best.</b>

151
02:12:26,866 --> 02:12:29,600
<b>But I just wanted to put that out.</b>

152
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:31,000
<b>I wanted to be honest with you guys.</b>

153
02:12:31,033 --> 02:12:32,733
<b>I'm not gonna lie and say like, oh, I have a PhD</b>

154
02:12:32,733 --> 02:12:33,533
<b>in this and that.</b>

155
02:12:33,933 --> 02:12:39,199
<b>You would be surprised that you're quite knowledgeable</b>

156
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:43,133
<b>because you really, really, even if it's a short time,</b>

157
02:12:43,133 --> 02:12:46,199
<b>you've, you've dicked a little bit.</b>

158
02:12:47,433 --> 02:12:50,433
<b>And I think some of the things you're saying might apply</b>

159
02:12:50,433 --> 02:12:53,166
<b>to some of us here in one way or the other.</b>

160
02:12:53,166 --> 02:12:54,699
<b>AI is a very broad field.</b>

161
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:57,533
<b>There are a lot of things that you even mentioned</b>

162
02:12:57,533 --> 02:13:00,033
<b>in this repository that I've never heard of.</b>

163
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:03,133
<b>Yeah, it's really broad field.</b>

164
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,566
<b>It's an amazing learning experience.</b>

165
02:13:06,666 --> 02:13:11,300
<b>Yeah, it's new enough that like lots of things</b>

166
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:13,066
<b>that are coming up is new enough that like,</b>

167
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:14,899
<b>as long as you can learn</b>

168
02:13:14,899 --> 02:13:16,699
<b>quickly, I think you can definitely</b>

169
02:13:16,699 --> 02:13:17,533
<b>be ahead of the goal.</b>

170
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:18,300
<b>Yeah.</b>

171
02:13:19,199 --> 02:13:22,100
<b>Yeah, and I think also don't be just too humble Josh.</b>

172
02:13:22,333 --> 02:13:25,800
<b>I think also not just about the experience because I feel</b>

173
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:28,133
<b>like especially with AI topic right now,</b>

174
02:13:28,666 --> 02:13:30,000
<b>everything come really quick.</b>

175
02:13:30,266 --> 02:13:32,100
<b>Like almost every month there's a new topic.</b>

176
02:13:32,633 --> 02:13:34,866
<b>Even you start researching this year.</b>

177
02:13:35,366 --> 02:13:37,166
<b>I think if you don't keep it up, like,</b>

178
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:39,533
<b>I feel like already lacking a little bit,</b>

179
02:13:39,533 --> 02:13:43,533
<b>like not reading the latest research paper or the topics,</b>

180
02:13:43,899 --> 02:13:46,166
<b>then I already don't know what's happening right now.</b>

181
02:13:46,166 --> 02:13:49,300
<b>So maybe your, your information or your knowledge</b>

182
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:51,399
<b>is already up to date and then me.</b>

183
02:13:52,133 --> 02:13:52,633
<b>Yeah, so.</b>

184
02:13:53,133 --> 02:13:55,633
<b>LLMs just came to light two years ago and now,</b>

185
02:13:56,633 --> 02:13:57,766
<b>like wait has gone.</b>

186
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:04,266
<b>Yeah, so I still remember when like chat GPT two came out</b>

187
02:14:04,266 --> 02:14:10,733
<b>or it's been so crazy, especially with the video generation</b>

188
02:14:10,966 --> 02:14:12,633
<b>stuff like that, that stuff is freaky.</b>

189
02:14:12,866 --> 02:14:14,300
<b>That's what got me into it.</b>

190
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:18,133
<b>Cause you know, Google Bayo three came out when I started</b>

191
02:14:19,433 --> 02:14:21,066
<b>some college classes, I was looking at it.</b>

192
02:14:21,066 --> 02:14:23,966
<b>I was like, I can barely discern this between reality.</b>

193
02:14:24,233 --> 02:14:25,133
<b>And you know, I got better at</b>

194
02:14:25,133 --> 02:14:27,133
<b>it eventually, but it's getting</b>

195
02:14:27,833 --> 02:14:28,833
<b>so good that it's scary.</b>

196
02:14:29,266 --> 02:14:30,433
<b>And you know, that uncally</b>

197
02:14:30,433 --> 02:14:32,433
<b>that uncanny Valley that we're in</b>

198
02:14:32,433 --> 02:14:35,100
<b>right now, it's closing up, it's closing up.</b>

199
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:35,800
<b>So we're going to see some</b>

200
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:38,000
<b>pretty impossible things come out</b>

201
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,366
<b>probably within the next 10 years.</b>

202
02:14:40,833 --> 02:14:41,933
<b>I want to be prepared for that.</b>

203
02:14:41,933 --> 02:14:42,766
<b>I want to be one of the people</b>

204
02:14:42,766 --> 02:14:43,833
<b>that understands that instead</b>

205
02:14:43,833 --> 02:14:44,699
<b>of just a consumer.</b>

206
02:14:45,366 --> 02:14:48,166
<b>Cause yeah, I'm, you know, one of my biggest fears is being</b>

207
02:14:48,233 --> 02:14:49,333
<b>controlled by that kind of stuff.</b>

208
02:14:50,933 --> 02:14:54,133
<b>But, you know, getting into this field has been like really</b>

209
02:14:54,233 --> 02:14:55,033
<b>enlightening for me.</b>

210
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:57,733
<b>It's kind of erased a lot of fears that I have AI.</b>

211
02:14:57,733 --> 02:15:00,433
<b>It's definitely opened up new ones as well, but I feel like</b>

212
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:04,233
<b>understanding it has been just really, really rewarding.</b>

213
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:05,500
<b>I feel like, yeah.</b>

214
02:15:07,033 --> 02:15:09,433
<b>Anyway, Deep D would, yeah.</b>

215
02:15:09,433 --> 02:15:12,066
<b>Would you like to kind of give an intro?</b>

216
02:15:12,533 --> 02:15:12,933
<b>Oh sure.</b>

217
02:15:13,833 --> 02:15:14,399
<b>Thank you.</b>

218
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:15,733
<b>Hi everyone.</b>

219
02:15:16,666 --> 02:15:17,699
<b>I am Deep D.</b>

220
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:20,033
<b>I'm from Georgia, USA.</b>

221
02:15:20,933 --> 02:15:26,766
<b>And I have experienced in multiple areas in software</b>

222
02:15:26,933 --> 02:15:32,000
<b>development recently and technical program management,</b>

223
02:15:32,199 --> 02:15:34,066
<b>program management, engineering management.</b>

224
02:15:34,699 --> 02:15:39,800
<b>Right now I'm working as a data scientist and I love data,</b>

225
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:45,233
<b>but I've also done a lot of AI ML programs,</b>

226
02:15:46,399 --> 02:15:48,333
<b>but not gen AI.</b>

227
02:15:48,633 --> 02:15:54,066
<b>So this is a great competition, the gen AI,</b>

228
02:15:54,399 --> 02:15:58,899
<b>and glad to find Josh on the team.</b>

229
02:15:59,133 --> 02:16:01,600
<b>You know, he has done some great work,</b>

230
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:06,100
<b>which I read through about contextual debt and looking</b>

231
02:16:06,233 --> 02:16:10,000
<b>forward to working with all of you on this,</b>

232
02:16:10,933 --> 02:16:12,566
<b>in this competition and in this team.</b>

233
02:16:13,666 --> 02:16:22,300
<b>So I have done a lot of AI ML, like supervised learning,</b>

234
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:29,433
<b>unsupervised learning, NLP, and also neural networks,</b>

235
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,200
<b>but mostly on the applied sciences side,</b>

236
02:16:32,466 --> 02:16:35,433
<b>not on the research, but gen</b>

237
02:16:35,433 --> 02:16:37,200
<b>AI is totally different, right?</b>

238
02:16:37,466 --> 02:16:41,299
<b>They've just gone miles ahead in,</b>

239
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:43,533
<b>everything.</b>

240
02:16:43,899 --> 02:16:47,899
<b>So, but it's not tough once you understand the basics.</b>

241
02:16:48,333 --> 02:16:53,000
<b>Yeah, this is, yeah, but this document, the contextual debt</b>

242
02:16:53,133 --> 02:16:57,133
<b>and how we take it forward by implementing the metrics</b>

243
02:16:57,433 --> 02:17:01,266
<b>and making the best and then taking it out,</b>

244
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:03,399
<b>you know, in the competition,</b>

245
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:06,433
<b>that would be a big, big thing for us to do.</b>

246
02:17:06,433 --> 02:17:08,033
<b>So thank you everyone.</b>

247
02:17:08,333 --> 02:17:08,899
<b>Thank you, Josh.</b>

248
02:17:11,966 --> 02:17:15,766
<b>And I sent LinkedIn request to every one of you.</b>

249
02:17:16,633 --> 02:17:18,299
<b>I think I already sent you a request.</b>

250
02:17:18,299 --> 02:17:20,399
<b>Yes, yes, you are already connected.</b>

251
02:17:20,899 --> 02:17:23,433
<b>Yes, I got your request a few days ago, I think.</b>

252
02:17:24,899 --> 02:17:25,566
<b>Josh sends yours.</b>

253
02:17:26,399 --> 02:17:26,600
<b>Yes.</b>

254
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:27,200
<b>Yeah.</b>

255
02:17:28,366 --> 02:17:29,366
<b>Oh, okay, okay.</b>

256
02:17:29,366 --> 02:17:29,633
<b>Thank you.</b>

257
02:17:30,233 --> 02:17:32,500
<b>Oh, and Gira, I think we actually have another person</b>

258
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:33,399
<b>in Germany too.</b>

259
02:17:34,366 --> 02:17:36,733
<b>I put his LinkedIn in the chat a few minutes ago.</b>

260
02:17:36,733 --> 02:17:37,466
<b>Oh, another one?</b>

261
02:17:38,133 --> 02:17:38,333
<b>Oh.</b>

262
02:17:39,433 --> 02:17:43,399
<b>Allah, so I'm gonna meet with him potentially late tonight</b>

263
02:17:43,399 --> 02:17:47,833
<b>if I'm not too tired when he wakes up.</b>

264
02:17:48,233 --> 02:17:49,399
<b>Cause it says he's in Germany.</b>

265
02:17:49,866 --> 02:17:52,533
<b>So I was hoping maybe you could connect with him</b>

266
02:17:52,533 --> 02:17:54,433
<b>and kind of pick his brain.</b>

267
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,333
<b>He seemed pretty interested in the project.</b>

268
02:17:59,733 --> 02:18:00,866
<b>He had some kind of,</b>

269
02:18:01,566 --> 02:18:03,633
<b>oh, he actually had some questions for us.</b>

270
02:18:04,833 --> 02:18:07,500
<b>So if you guys want like later in the meeting,</b>

271
02:18:08,066 --> 02:18:10,100
<b>we can kind of cover those.</b>

272
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:14,933
<b>Okay, I'll just give a quick intro as well.</b>

273
02:18:15,966 --> 02:18:16,433
<b>Just overall.</b>

274
02:18:16,899 --> 02:18:17,933
<b>So I'm Samuel.</b>

275
02:18:18,299 --> 02:18:20,899
<b>I'm actually a year for</b>

276
02:18:22,133 --> 02:18:24,533
<b>biomedical engineering student in NUS.</b>

277
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:28,333
<b>But I've been working in like, on like,</b>

278
02:18:28,333 --> 02:18:30,899
<b>AI, ML stuff, self-taught for about like five years.</b>

279
02:18:31,533 --> 02:18:35,166
<b>Done two internships at like two of the research labs</b>

280
02:18:35,333 --> 02:18:36,466
<b>in Singapore.</b>

281
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:41,033
<b>One on like a kind of like signal propagation using AI, ML,</b>

282
02:18:41,533 --> 02:18:42,500
<b>some computer vision stuff.</b>

283
02:18:43,299 --> 02:18:46,233
<b>And similarly, I also did computer vision with</b>

284
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:50,299
<b>some A star, so science research lab.</b>

285
02:18:50,966 --> 02:18:51,166
<b>Yeah.</b>

286
02:18:51,733 --> 02:18:54,700
<b>And after that, I spent one year in Silicon Valley.</b>

287
02:18:55,333 --> 02:18:58,500
<b>Basically first I was with data science.</b>

288
02:18:59,299 --> 02:19:01,299
<b>I was doing data science with a battery company.</b>

289
02:19:01,866 --> 02:19:02,700
<b>They're called Q-Burg.</b>

290
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:05,000
<b>They were trying to put batteries on planes, basically.</b>

291
02:19:05,833 --> 02:19:07,733
<b>The problem now is that batteries are too heavy.</b>

292
02:19:08,266 --> 02:19:10,200
<b>So they were trying to make this like really energy dense</b>

293
02:19:10,333 --> 02:19:14,466
<b>battery that could like basically be on planes</b>

294
02:19:14,466 --> 02:19:15,166
<b>and power planes.</b>

295
02:19:17,066 --> 02:19:19,066
<b>But I was on the data science team for that.</b>

296
02:19:19,899 --> 02:19:21,833
<b>And, but they closed down.</b>

297
02:19:22,333 --> 02:19:23,600
<b>So I had to find another job.</b>

298
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:27,466
<b>Which was actually a good thing.</b>

299
02:19:27,799 --> 02:19:31,233
<b>Because the next company I worked at basically was</b>

300
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:35,633
<b>this company working on Gen. AI for manufacturing firms.</b>

301
02:19:36,533 --> 02:19:39,533
<b>So basically they were trying to automate a lot of like</b>

302
02:19:39,533 --> 02:19:42,399
<b>the sales processes for these legacy manufacturing firms.</b>

303
02:19:42,633 --> 02:19:45,566
<b>Because the current process is really manual.</b>

304
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:50,366
<b>They do like basically customer sending purchase orders</b>

305
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:51,733
<b>like in all sorts of formats.</b>

306
02:19:52,333 --> 02:19:55,100
<b>And the salesperson will have to look through each format.</b>

307
02:19:55,766 --> 02:19:57,466
<b>And there's a central database,</b>

308
02:19:57,566 --> 02:19:58,799
<b>but the customers don't follow that.</b>

309
02:19:59,433 --> 02:20:02,000
<b>So they just try their best to match</b>

310
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:03,266
<b>based on the customer's request.</b>

311
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:05,500
<b>And it takes up a lot of the sales people's time.</b>

312
02:20:05,966 --> 02:20:08,399
<b>So we were basically using like OCR,</b>

313
02:20:09,366 --> 02:20:11,533
<b>optical character condition,</b>

314
02:20:11,799 --> 02:20:14,333
<b>and like a few of like the cutting edge models</b>

315
02:20:14,533 --> 02:20:16,333
<b>to like kind of pass the information</b>

316
02:20:16,666 --> 02:20:19,033
<b>and fit that into like a table basically.</b>

317
02:20:19,566 --> 02:20:21,633
<b>So that, and do some semantics such as to basically</b>

318
02:20:21,633 --> 02:20:23,700
<b>get up like the best information.</b>

319
02:20:24,399 --> 02:20:27,100
<b>So I was with them for like three months.</b>

320
02:20:27,899 --> 02:20:28,700
<b>Very interesting.</b>

321
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:31,600
<b>It was like five of us in a house,</b>

322
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:35,066
<b>a five-person house working day and night</b>

323
02:20:35,299 --> 02:20:36,633
<b>and shipping products.</b>

324
02:20:37,433 --> 02:20:41,533
<b>So that, and then I've also done like,</b>

325
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:44,066
<b>I think a lot of hackathons,</b>

326
02:20:44,766 --> 02:20:47,000
<b>maybe one like 10 plus different hackathons.</b>

327
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:51,299
<b>But yeah, so okay, that's just a bit about me.</b>

328
02:20:52,033 --> 02:20:54,266
<b>I think it's cool that Josh has self-thought</b>

329
02:20:54,266 --> 02:20:57,299
<b>more so kind of self-thought still learning as well.</b>

330
02:20:57,299 --> 02:20:59,233
<b>And I think it's always great to meet people</b>

331
02:20:59,233 --> 02:21:02,899
<b>who are interested to learn and do new things,</b>

332
02:21:02,899 --> 02:21:03,933
<b>which I think is all of you guys.</b>

333
02:21:04,333 --> 02:21:06,166
<b>So exciting stuff.</b>

334
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:08,866
<b>Sweet.</b>

335
02:21:09,733 --> 02:21:10,600
<b>That's awesome.</b>

336
02:21:12,133 --> 02:21:13,200
<b>Yeah, it's really cool to know</b>

337
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:16,033
<b>that somebody else here is self-taught as well.</b>

338
02:21:16,799 --> 02:21:18,733
<b>I definitely have a lot of imposter syndrome.</b>

339
02:21:18,733 --> 02:21:21,700
<b>I'm getting over that, but I don't know,</b>

340
02:21:21,733 --> 02:21:24,733
<b>just being able to kind of like build off</b>

341
02:21:24,733 --> 02:21:25,733
<b>of each other's strengths.</b>

342
02:21:25,733 --> 02:21:29,100
<b>It's just a great feeling.</b>

343
02:21:29,666 --> 02:21:29,899
<b>Sorry.</b>

344
02:21:32,466 --> 02:21:32,666
<b>Okay.</b>

345
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:34,633
<b>Yeah, okay.</b>

346
02:21:34,833 --> 02:21:39,633
<b>So since we're kind of done with the icebreakers right now,</b>

347
02:21:40,299 --> 02:21:43,433
<b>I was, let's see what kind of agenda that I had</b>

348
02:21:43,433 --> 02:21:44,433
<b>for the rest of the meeting.</b>

349
02:21:44,433 --> 02:21:45,533
<b>And it's, this is open.</b>

350
02:21:45,533 --> 02:21:47,633
<b>This is totally like modular here.</b>

351
02:21:47,633 --> 02:21:50,233
<b>We don't have to follow this through the T to the T.</b>

352
02:21:52,299 --> 02:21:54,000
<b>But I just kind of wanted to give us a little bit</b>

353
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,799
<b>of a foundation to work with.</b>

354
02:21:57,799 --> 02:21:58,000
<b>Okay.</b>

355
02:21:58,033 --> 02:22:00,533
<b>So we all kind of like understand what contextual that is,</b>

356
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,366
<b>the code AI code that works,</b>

357
02:22:02,366 --> 02:22:04,500
<b>but it lacks intent reasoning and safety</b>

358
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:07,833
<b>that it kind of parallels AI agents themselves.</b>

359
02:22:10,133 --> 02:22:12,066
<b>LLMs, they kind of mimic reasoning.</b>

360
02:22:12,066 --> 02:22:13,133
<b>They kind of simulate it,</b>

361
02:22:13,133 --> 02:22:15,433
<b>but they're not exactly self-aware.</b>

362
02:22:16,399 --> 02:22:22,233
<b>I kind of wanted to talk about the cyber-sensorial agent</b>

363
02:22:22,233 --> 02:22:23,299
<b>a little bit.</b>

364
02:22:25,433 --> 02:22:29,000
<b>Do you guys have any like takeaways</b>

365
02:22:29,500 --> 02:22:31,733
<b>from the approach that's being used</b>

366
02:22:31,899 --> 02:22:35,233
<b>in like the planning and documentation to describe that?</b>

367
02:22:36,033 --> 02:22:38,333
<b>Does any aspect of it kind of seem like confusing</b>

368
02:22:39,433 --> 02:22:43,133
<b>or do you guys feel like it's consistent</b>

369
02:22:43,433 --> 02:22:44,733
<b>with like the rest of the code base?</b>

370
02:22:45,766 --> 02:22:50,833
<b>(audio cuts out)</b>

371
02:22:50,833 --> 02:22:54,266
<b>Like using the philosophy as like agent as a judge,</b>

372
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:58,033
<b>using AI to like evaluate other AI processes.</b>

373
02:23:01,033 --> 02:23:02,100
<b>And like don't, you know, the whole thing</b>

374
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:03,633
<b>with the contextual integrity score,</b>

375
02:23:03,633 --> 02:23:05,333
<b>I kind of wanted to talk about that too,</b>

376
02:23:05,333 --> 02:23:08,333
<b>because the website, it gives like a very high level</b>

377
02:23:08,633 --> 02:23:11,166
<b>overview, but more recently I</b>

378
02:23:11,166 --> 02:23:12,166
<b>was trying to figure out like,</b>

379
02:23:12,933 --> 02:23:16,833
<b>okay, like what kind of logic can we lay out for this?</b>

380
02:23:16,833 --> 02:23:19,233
<b>Because that was one of Deepti's first questions</b>

381
02:23:19,233 --> 02:23:20,633
<b>when she looked at the repository.</b>

382
02:23:21,333 --> 02:23:24,033
<b>And I spent a bit of time chewing over it.</b>

383
02:23:24,799 --> 02:23:29,133
<b>And I kind of came up with some solutions.</b>

384
02:23:30,366 --> 02:23:32,533
<b>I linked to those in the strategic master log,</b>

385
02:23:33,299 --> 02:23:35,933
<b>which is this, you know, it's that large document</b>

386
02:23:35,933 --> 02:23:38,933
<b>that holds like all the overarching links to it.</b>

387
02:23:39,533 --> 02:23:43,466
<b>I think the specific document that I'm talking about</b>

388
02:23:44,033 --> 02:23:49,666
<b>is the, yeah, here it is, the strategic pivot plan,</b>

389
02:23:49,666 --> 02:23:52,266
<b>CIS formation, because there's like,</b>

390
02:23:52,266 --> 02:23:54,100
<b>did you see all those functions in there</b>

391
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:55,033
<b>and one of those documents?</b>

392
02:23:55,266 --> 02:23:57,133
<b>Did any of you guys come across that?</b>

393
02:23:57,133 --> 02:23:59,500
<b>If not, I can share my screen in just a second.</b>

394
02:24:02,266 --> 02:24:05,100
<b>I'm sure you guys are like really advanced in math</b>

395
02:24:05,799 --> 02:24:08,066
<b>and stuff like that, but it basically just lays out</b>

396
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:09,700
<b>the logic of like, okay, how do we measure</b>

397
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:11,266
<b>each aspect of the code?</b>

398
02:24:12,899 --> 02:24:15,333
<b>So we can kind of cover that for a little bit.</b>

399
02:24:15,566 --> 02:24:16,933
<b>It goes into vector embeddings,</b>

400
02:24:17,333 --> 02:24:19,000
<b>like math theory a little bit.</b>

401
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,700
<b>But yeah, I don't know if you guys had any questions</b>

402
02:24:22,866 --> 02:24:23,633
<b>about that or?</b>

403
02:24:25,799 --> 02:24:29,233
<b>Yeah, Josh, I think I shared some like high level</b>

404
02:24:29,466 --> 02:24:31,366
<b>notes I had with you over Discord.</b>

405
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:40,133
<b>And I can just, okay, so before anyone else has like stuff,</b>

406
02:24:40,133 --> 02:24:42,433
<b>before I dive into that, yeah.</b>

407
02:24:43,700 --> 02:24:47,733
<b>Okay, so I think in terms of like agent as a charge,</b>

408
02:24:48,899 --> 02:24:53,333
<b>one of the ways that I have used to like some success</b>

409
02:24:53,333 --> 02:24:56,166
<b>in the past to like evaluate scores is,</b>

410
02:24:56,700 --> 02:24:58,000
<b>and I think you have some of this now,</b>

411
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,633
<b>which is basically you define like a set of bricks</b>

412
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:04,766
<b>and maybe each thing can be assigned a score</b>

413
02:25:05,466 --> 02:25:11,299
<b>and basically use that to, use like different kinds</b>

414
02:25:11,299 --> 02:25:13,299
<b>of rubrics, so like maybe you have five different</b>

415
02:25:14,299 --> 02:25:19,433
<b>assessing criteria to kind of like aggregate scores</b>

416
02:25:19,433 --> 02:25:20,299
<b>across those things.</b>

417
02:25:21,233 --> 02:25:25,700
<b>So that's been useful rather than just telling the agent</b>

418
02:25:25,700 --> 02:25:26,899
<b>to like straight away give a score,</b>

419
02:25:28,333 --> 02:25:30,866
<b>like just aggregating across different benchmarks,</b>

420
02:25:31,166 --> 02:25:32,733
<b>getting the reason over those things</b>

421
02:25:33,299 --> 02:25:34,866
<b>and then aggregating the score based on that,</b>

422
02:25:35,566 --> 02:25:36,833
<b>if that's clear, yeah.</b>

423
02:25:37,233 --> 02:25:39,733
<b>So I think in terms of like getting agent as a charge,</b>

424
02:25:39,733 --> 02:25:42,566
<b>I mean, LMM as a judge, that's quite reasonable.</b>

425
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:44,533
<b>Maybe it's been done in quite a few papers.</b>

426
02:25:44,799 --> 02:25:46,933
<b>I implemented one paper that was doing that</b>

427
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:48,566
<b>when I was in my previous company as well.</b>

428
02:25:49,333 --> 02:25:51,066
<b>So yeah, on the contextual scoring thing,</b>

429
02:25:51,066 --> 02:25:52,200
<b>I think that's fine.</b>

430
02:25:53,399 --> 02:25:57,500
<b>For vector embeddings, and anyone else that has like</b>

431
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:00,133
<b>kind of experience working with like vectors and stuff</b>

432
02:26:00,266 --> 02:26:05,533
<b>and also timing here, I think the scoring itself,</b>

433
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:11,833
<b>like there's the approach that we actually can take</b>

434
02:26:12,666 --> 02:26:14,966
<b>to actually get like some core similarity between intent</b>

435
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:18,366
<b>and like code diffs, for example, like the changes,</b>

436
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:19,633
<b>which you can get from Git.</b>

437
02:26:21,033 --> 02:26:22,833
<b>That's something we can do, but I don't think</b>

438
02:26:22,833 --> 02:26:24,799
<b>there's a specific model that is trained for that.</b>

439
02:26:25,399 --> 02:26:28,100
<b>And from my experience, if you do like similarity search</b>

440
02:26:28,299 --> 02:26:32,433
<b>for embeddings, for example, it doesn't do very well</b>

441
02:26:32,833 --> 02:26:36,166
<b>if you do like top one, if that makes sense.</b>

442
02:26:36,166 --> 02:26:38,566
<b>Like basically you try and get like the first result,</b>

443
02:26:38,566 --> 02:26:42,200
<b>but probably the result is like top 20.</b>

444
02:26:42,433 --> 02:26:44,200
<b>So in terms of like encoding intent,</b>

445
02:26:45,799 --> 02:26:48,000
<b>I think it will be useful as a metric,</b>

446
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,600
<b>but probably not a BOR and all,</b>

447
02:26:50,133 --> 02:26:51,399
<b>even though I think that would be helpful</b>

448
02:26:51,399 --> 02:26:53,600
<b>to help us encode it in a mathematical sense.</b>

449
02:26:54,433 --> 02:26:56,500
<b>Yeah, so that's another thing.</b>

450
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:59,100
<b>And for the graph side of things,</b>

451
02:26:59,799 --> 02:27:02,633
<b>okay, I don't wanna talk too much in detail</b>

452
02:27:02,633 --> 02:27:04,766
<b>on this part first, but just focusing on the contextual</b>

453
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:08,299
<b>portion, like contextual debt, I think vectors</b>

454
02:27:08,633 --> 02:27:10,899
<b>and using LMS to judge, makes sense,</b>

455
02:27:10,899 --> 02:27:14,000
<b>but probably the vectors will just be like a helping</b>

456
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:16,500
<b>mechanism rather than like the main mechanism.</b>

457
02:27:19,299 --> 02:27:19,700
<b>That's sweet.</b>

458
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,500
<b>Yeah, I hope that's clear.</b>

459
02:27:22,966 --> 02:27:25,500
<b>At least let me know if like, I'm not,</b>

460
02:27:26,966 --> 02:27:28,899
<b>yeah, if anything is confusing</b>

461
02:27:28,899 --> 02:27:32,766
<b>cause I think different, maybe I'm not communicating</b>

462
02:27:32,933 --> 02:27:34,200
<b>as well as I could, yeah.</b>

463
02:27:36,433 --> 02:27:39,700
<b>I think that's, yeah, that's kind of coming across to me,</b>

464
02:27:39,899 --> 02:27:43,533
<b>but does anybody else have questions about that?</b>

465
02:27:44,833 --> 02:27:45,933
<b>Like, are we on the same page?</b>

466
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:50,799
<b>It's okay if we're not, because I'm gonna be,</b>

467
02:27:50,833 --> 02:27:53,399
<b>so I'm gonna be providing the transcript</b>

468
02:27:53,399 --> 02:27:55,100
<b>of this meeting afterwards to everybody</b>

469
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:56,233
<b>so that we can kind of review,</b>

470
02:27:56,233 --> 02:27:57,666
<b>cause I know we're covering a lot today.</b>

471
02:27:58,733 --> 02:28:00,600
<b>I'm definitely gonna need stuff simplified to me.</b>

472
02:28:01,133 --> 02:28:02,766
<b>So I'm just kind of rolling with the punches here.</b>

473
02:28:03,766 --> 02:28:06,333
<b>But that sounded good to me.</b>

474
02:28:08,366 --> 02:28:11,899
<b>So I kind of wanted to cover this document.</b>

475
02:28:11,899 --> 02:28:14,399
<b>I don't know if you guys, do you guys all have access</b>

476
02:28:14,399 --> 02:28:16,133
<b>to the GitHub repository right now?</b>

477
02:28:19,766 --> 02:28:20,899
<b>Okay, everybody, okay.</b>

478
02:28:21,299 --> 02:28:25,166
<b>So this one specifically goes into,</b>

479
02:28:25,566 --> 02:28:28,600
<b>did what you were talking about kind of reference</b>

480
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:30,700
<b>any of this stuff, Samuel?</b>

481
02:28:31,333 --> 02:28:34,066
<b>Because this stuff like throws out a bunch of stuff</b>

482
02:28:34,333 --> 02:28:39,299
<b>on like basically like, oh man, how do I simplify this?</b>

483
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:47,166
<b>I guess semantic density.</b>

484
02:28:47,966 --> 02:28:50,166
<b>Is that a familiar term for you guys, semantic density?</b>

485
02:28:55,299 --> 02:28:58,500
<b>I have a guess, but I have one, we'll see.</b>

486
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:00,733
<b>Okay, this is definitely gonna be a--</b>

487
02:29:01,233 --> 02:29:03,466
<b>Let me check if my guess is correct.</b>

488
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:07,299
<b>I also wanted to say it sounds familiar,</b>

489
02:29:07,299 --> 02:29:11,033
<b>but I think it's a good question. Yeah, I think it's a good question. Yeah, I think it's a good question. It sounds familiar, but you wouldn't be sure.</b>

490
02:29:11,333 --> 02:29:13,933
<b>What I'm guessing it means too is that it's like</b>

491
02:29:14,233 --> 02:29:20,433
<b>how much detail is in the structure of words, right?</b>

492
02:29:20,733 --> 02:29:24,933
<b>Because like, I'm guessing an example of like loose,</b>

493
02:29:25,733 --> 02:29:28,799
<b>like something that isn't semantically dense would be like,</b>

494
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:31,033
<b>you know, the boy crossed the street.</b>

495
02:29:32,333 --> 02:29:34,500
<b>Something that would be semantically dense would be</b>

496
02:29:35,533 --> 02:29:39,733
<b>like the male age six to eight years old, Brown hair.</b>

497
02:29:41,333 --> 02:29:43,866
<b>He stepped with his right foot</b>

498
02:29:43,866 --> 02:29:45,333
<b>and then step with his left foot</b>

499
02:29:45,899 --> 02:29:48,733
<b>from the North side of the asphalt,</b>

500
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,500
<b>all the way, you know, stuff like that, right?</b>

501
02:29:51,233 --> 02:29:52,899
<b>That's what I'm guessing semantic density is</b>

502
02:29:52,899 --> 02:29:56,866
<b>like a very compressed nutshell of how it's used</b>

503
02:29:57,133 --> 02:29:59,333
<b>in like LLM systems.</b>

504
02:29:59,333 --> 02:30:00,233
<b>But anyway, this document,</b>

505
02:30:00,733 --> 02:30:04,066
<b>it goes into some really complicated to me functions.</b>

506
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:06,799
<b>Okay.</b>

507
02:30:07,366 --> 02:30:09,633
<b>It talks about like vector embeddings and stuff like that.</b>

508
02:30:09,633 --> 02:30:13,333
<b>And I was just hoping like maybe you guys would be able to</b>

509
02:30:14,733 --> 02:30:16,733
<b>like not exactly tell me what it means,</b>

510
02:30:18,333 --> 02:30:20,700
<b>but whether or not it has any relevance</b>

511
02:30:20,700 --> 02:30:22,100
<b>to the ideas that you have.</b>

512
02:30:22,333 --> 02:30:23,899
<b>And ironically, it's a</b>

513
02:30:23,899 --> 02:30:26,433
<b>semantically dense document in itself.</b>

514
02:30:28,166 --> 02:30:31,066
<b>I barely understand it, but from what I understand,</b>

515
02:30:31,366 --> 02:30:33,533
<b>it's basically trying to come up with the logic</b>

516
02:30:33,766 --> 02:30:36,766
<b>for each parts of the contextual integrity score.</b>

517
02:30:37,233 --> 02:30:38,500
<b>Like going back to the website,</b>

518
02:30:38,733 --> 02:30:42,299
<b>it kind of bases it on those three pillars.</b>

519
02:30:42,866 --> 02:30:45,566
<b>I'm sure everybody's familiar with that too, right?</b>

520
02:30:46,566 --> 02:30:47,833
<b>It's architectural integrity.</b>

521
02:30:48,933 --> 02:30:50,399
<b>I think it's test integrity.</b>

522
02:30:50,733 --> 02:30:52,500
<b>And then there's one more.</b>

523
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:55,166
<b>Let me see if we can.</b>

524
02:30:55,399 --> 02:30:55,766
<b>Rationale?</b>

525
02:30:58,433 --> 02:31:01,866
<b>Yes, it's rational integrity score, which is the Y.</b>

526
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:06,299
<b>And that kind of exists in the documentation</b>

527
02:31:06,766 --> 02:31:08,799
<b>or at least even just code comments</b>

528
02:31:08,799 --> 02:31:10,833
<b>in the functional requirement of the code itself.</b>

529
02:31:11,899 --> 02:31:14,333
<b>So what this document, which contains like</b>

530
02:31:15,533 --> 02:31:17,633
<b>a bunch of chicken scratch to me personally,</b>

531
02:31:18,433 --> 02:31:20,100
<b>it kind of tries to find the rationale</b>

532
02:31:20,333 --> 02:31:21,500
<b>for evaluating that stuff.</b>

533
02:31:23,766 --> 02:31:27,733
<b>And honestly, I was hoping we could chew on it</b>

534
02:31:27,899 --> 02:31:29,366
<b>over the next week and figure out</b>

535
02:31:30,299 --> 02:31:32,899
<b>if it's something that we wanna pursue deeper</b>

536
02:31:33,833 --> 02:31:36,000
<b>because it has a pretty big variance</b>

537
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:39,799
<b>from some of the plans that I have laid out</b>

538
02:31:39,799 --> 02:31:43,200
<b>for this project, which don't exactly go into any detail</b>

539
02:31:43,733 --> 02:31:47,600
<b>of how exactly we do evaluate using those three pillars.</b>

540
02:31:47,933 --> 02:31:50,233
<b>Like, there's high level overviews</b>

541
02:31:50,233 --> 02:31:53,133
<b>of how we use the structure of that</b>

542
02:31:53,299 --> 02:31:56,100
<b>to come up with a weighted score at the end.</b>

543
02:31:57,033 --> 02:31:58,933
<b>But this document, like it goes</b>

544
02:31:58,933 --> 02:32:01,399
<b>into a proposed specific structure.</b>

545
02:32:03,399 --> 02:32:06,200
<b>So yeah, I kind of just wanted to talk about that.</b>

546
02:32:07,133 --> 02:32:09,833
<b>I'm sorry if it kind of got us off track a little bit,</b>

547
02:32:09,833 --> 02:32:12,399
<b>but yeah, because this is pretty much one</b>

548
02:32:12,399 --> 02:32:15,333
<b>of the most recent bits of research I've done.</b>

549
02:32:15,333 --> 02:32:17,600
<b>And it's the first time that I've actually kind of</b>

550
02:32:18,166 --> 02:32:19,700
<b>hit a brick wall in my understanding</b>

551
02:32:19,899 --> 02:32:21,600
<b>because I'm not very good at math.</b>

552
02:32:21,766 --> 02:32:24,066
<b>I'm not very good at like logic and functions like that.</b>

553
02:32:24,466 --> 02:32:25,266
<b>It's not my forte.</b>

554
02:32:26,666 --> 02:32:28,033
<b>So I was hoping that maybe you guys,</b>

555
02:32:28,299 --> 02:32:30,600
<b>your PhD students, maybe you guys</b>

556
02:32:30,799 --> 02:32:32,933
<b>had some familiarity with this.</b>

557
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:37,500
<b>It's okay if you don't, we can work with that.</b>

558
02:32:38,133 --> 02:32:40,000
<b>This document started from some way.</b>

559
02:32:40,366 --> 02:32:47,466
<b>Is it like, this is just focusing on the architecture?</b>

560
02:32:49,466 --> 02:32:54,000
<b>Yeah, yeah, kind of just, sorry.</b>

561
02:32:56,399 --> 02:32:59,533
<b>Yeah, this would kind of be the logic</b>

562
02:32:59,533 --> 02:33:02,866
<b>that the architecture would be built to follow</b>

563
02:33:04,633 --> 02:33:06,333
<b>for the contextual integrity score.</b>

564
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:11,100
<b>But honestly, it's really dense for me.</b>

565
02:33:12,033 --> 02:33:15,200
<b>So I was just kind of hoping to see what you guys had</b>

566
02:33:15,433 --> 02:33:19,233
<b>as an opinion on it, but it's okay if it's kind of,</b>

567
02:33:19,966 --> 02:33:22,533
<b>like it's okay if it's like too distracting to cover today</b>

568
02:33:24,466 --> 02:33:25,799
<b>because I haven't really had enough time</b>

569
02:33:25,799 --> 02:33:27,666
<b>to compare it to the rest of the code base yet.</b>

570
02:33:31,766 --> 02:33:33,399
<b>Like it's a lot, it's a lot.</b>

571
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:36,433
<b>You guys saw the link that I put in the chat, right?</b>

572
02:33:36,433 --> 02:33:37,799
<b>Like are you guys looking at it right now?</b>

573
02:33:39,033 --> 02:33:42,933
<b>Yeah, one of the things I looked at</b>

574
02:33:43,133 --> 02:33:48,733
<b>was the copyright edition paper.</b>

575
02:33:50,166 --> 02:33:50,500
<b>Oh yeah.</b>

576
02:33:52,799 --> 02:33:55,433
<b>I haven't copyrighted anything yet.</b>

577
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:56,899
<b>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</b>

578
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:58,100
<b>That's just a suggestion.</b>

579
02:34:03,633 --> 02:34:06,233
<b>So I'm on my phone now,</b>

580
02:34:06,233 --> 02:34:08,766
<b>so it's a little difficult to like look at the code.</b>

581
02:34:10,233 --> 02:34:12,333
<b>When you're referring to like semantic density,</b>

582
02:34:12,566 --> 02:34:13,766
<b>there's a paper about it.</b>

583
02:34:14,233 --> 02:34:16,200
<b>Is that like the thing you're talking about?</b>

584
02:34:16,733 --> 02:34:18,966
<b>Like there's a paper that actually writes about</b>

585
02:34:19,566 --> 02:34:20,299
<b>semantic density.</b>

586
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:21,733
<b>So I was--</b>

587
02:34:22,733 --> 02:34:25,000
<b>Please, if you could share it though, that would be good.</b>

588
02:34:25,833 --> 02:34:26,666
<b>Oh sure, yeah.</b>

589
02:34:27,233 --> 02:34:30,233
<b>I definitely need an introduction to a lot of these terms</b>

590
02:34:30,233 --> 02:34:31,399
<b>that are thrown around here.</b>

591
02:34:31,700 --> 02:34:31,899
<b>Sure.</b>

592
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:37,700
<b>I would say what is contained in the paper might be,</b>

593
02:34:39,399 --> 02:34:42,500
<b>like it could be useful, but I think in a,</b>

594
02:34:44,733 --> 02:34:48,200
<b>okay like I need to look a little deeper at it</b>

595
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:50,433
<b>because I just skimmed it.</b>

596
02:34:50,766 --> 02:34:51,000
<b>It's crazy.</b>

597
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:56,533
<b>Basically like the point is that it needs sampling.</b>

598
02:34:57,566 --> 02:35:01,000
<b>So basically like what that means is you need to like</b>

599
02:35:01,033 --> 02:35:03,899
<b>generate multiple responses from the LLM</b>

600
02:35:04,333 --> 02:35:05,333
<b>in order to kind of get,</b>

601
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:07,899
<b>okay let me send over the paper before I start rambling.</b>

602
02:35:08,666 --> 02:35:12,233
<b>Is it really with uncertainty quantification?</b>

603
02:35:13,133 --> 02:35:14,500
<b>Yes, that's the one I think.</b>

604
02:35:15,366 --> 02:35:17,100
<b>Should be the first one when you search semantic density.</b>

605
02:35:19,333 --> 02:35:21,733
<b>Yeah, so in a real world use case,</b>

606
02:35:21,766 --> 02:35:23,600
<b>I don't think we would do a lot of,</b>

607
02:35:24,666 --> 02:35:26,533
<b>we could do multiple samples,</b>

608
02:35:28,100 --> 02:35:29,233
<b>but I don't think we would,</b>

609
02:35:29,833 --> 02:35:31,433
<b>but okay, we can look a bit more,</b>

610
02:35:31,433 --> 02:35:32,733
<b>I'll look a bit more into it and see</b>

611
02:35:33,033 --> 02:35:34,566
<b>and dive into some of like the equations,</b>

612
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:41,500
<b>but I would say for determining this,</b>

613
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:45,133
<b>some form of semantic similarity might be enough.</b>

614
02:35:46,133 --> 02:35:48,500
<b>Nothing crazy, but I could be wrong</b>

615
02:35:48,766 --> 02:35:50,933
<b>and I think definitely we should look more into like</b>

616
02:35:51,399 --> 02:35:53,399
<b>some of these details that,</b>

617
02:35:54,333 --> 02:35:55,766
<b>yeah, just off the top of my head,</b>

618
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:00,200
<b>we might not need to like overly complexify it,</b>

619
02:36:00,466 --> 02:36:01,899
<b>but yeah, I think it'd be good</b>

620
02:36:02,100 --> 02:36:03,566
<b>if people could look into the paper</b>

621
02:36:03,766 --> 02:36:05,533
<b>and let me know if you have different thoughts.</b>

622
02:36:06,366 --> 02:36:08,266
<b>And this just from my skimming anyway.</b>

623
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,200
<b>Yeah, so it depends on how we want to scope it</b>

624
02:36:12,533 --> 02:36:15,600
<b>that might not be super necessary.</b>

625
02:36:16,133 --> 02:36:19,399
<b>But it's an interesting concept in terms of how you get.</b>

626
02:36:20,966 --> 02:36:21,366
<b>Okay, sweet.</b>

627
02:36:21,799 --> 02:36:23,700
<b>Basically to figure out how uncertain, yeah.</b>

628
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:26,899
<b>Uncertain, certain responses of the LNN,</b>

629
02:36:27,166 --> 02:36:30,700
<b>it's more of like confidence in the response.</b>

630
02:36:32,866 --> 02:36:33,433
<b>Gotcha, okay.</b>

631
02:36:33,633 --> 02:36:34,733
<b>Okay, that makes more sense.</b>

632
02:36:37,299 --> 02:36:37,766
<b>Okay, sweet.</b>

633
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:43,500
<b>So yeah, I really didn't wanna get too much off track</b>

634
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,533
<b>because like we, you know, so far,</b>

635
02:36:45,533 --> 02:36:47,533
<b>there's a pretty good solid plan in here.</b>

636
02:36:48,166 --> 02:36:52,266
<b>And we have about, what's the deadline, December 19th?</b>

637
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:54,799
<b>We have a set amount of time</b>

638
02:36:54,799 --> 02:36:57,366
<b>that we have to complete a purple agent.</b>

639
02:36:57,766 --> 02:37:00,566
<b>So I do wanna be realistic with time management.</b>

640
02:37:01,399 --> 02:37:03,533
<b>I don't wanna get too crazy in these deep rabbit holes</b>

641
02:37:03,533 --> 02:37:06,200
<b>and like alter the plan to a certain point</b>

642
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:08,866
<b>where it becomes impossible for us to complete it</b>

643
02:37:08,866 --> 02:37:09,533
<b>by the deadline.</b>

644
02:37:10,866 --> 02:37:12,133
<b>That is a concern that I have.</b>

645
02:37:13,033 --> 02:37:17,666
<b>So yeah, so I'm, but yeah, that's good.</b>

646
02:37:18,033 --> 02:37:19,866
<b>I'm glad that we could kind of cover that today.</b>

647
02:37:21,299 --> 02:37:25,833
<b>In terms of, I'm trying to find the onboarding agenda.</b>

648
02:37:26,066 --> 02:37:26,500
<b>Here we go.</b>

649
02:37:27,566 --> 02:37:30,166
<b>Okay, yeah, so has everybody cloned the repository</b>

650
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:33,799
<b>to like their personal computer and tried to, you know,</b>

651
02:37:33,799 --> 02:37:35,533
<b>just poke around at the code a little bit,</b>

652
02:37:36,733 --> 02:37:39,733
<b>you know, installed all the modules and stuff.</b>

653
02:37:40,233 --> 02:37:45,100
<b>Did the Docker, did the Docker window work and all of that?</b>

654
02:37:48,633 --> 02:37:50,766
<b>I'll be really straight.</b>

655
02:37:51,133 --> 02:37:52,799
<b>I have not tried to run a Docker,</b>

656
02:37:54,100 --> 02:37:55,733
<b>I've just been looking through the code</b>

657
02:37:55,733 --> 02:37:56,866
<b>and some other documents.</b>

658
02:37:57,399 --> 02:37:58,100
<b>Okay, okay.</b>

659
02:37:58,566 --> 02:38:00,299
<b>So the Docker should be working.</b>

660
02:38:01,633 --> 02:38:04,533
<b>I made sure it was all cleaned up, you know,</b>

661
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:06,333
<b>everything's up to spec.</b>

662
02:38:09,166 --> 02:38:13,100
<b>So, yeah, so it's kind of,</b>

663
02:38:13,433 --> 02:38:15,933
<b>because there's kind of a point of criticality.</b>

664
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:20,433
<b>There's like in terms of the project plan,</b>

665
02:38:20,433 --> 02:38:22,799
<b>and then there's like that recovery plan</b>

666
02:38:22,933 --> 02:38:26,766
<b>that I created on November 13th,</b>

667
02:38:26,833 --> 02:38:30,066
<b>which was created after I compared the current plan</b>

668
02:38:30,799 --> 02:38:34,533
<b>before that to a big paper that was done on like</b>

669
02:38:35,033 --> 02:38:36,399
<b>what the judges are going to expect,</b>

670
02:38:36,399 --> 02:38:38,899
<b>how our competition is going to be scored.</b>

671
02:38:40,433 --> 02:38:45,000
<b>Stuff like the, I think it's Auth0,</b>

672
02:38:45,899 --> 02:38:48,399
<b>that company that's sponsoring,</b>

673
02:38:48,399 --> 02:38:50,333
<b>they're going to want to see some kind of compatibility</b>

674
02:38:50,533 --> 02:38:52,333
<b>with our project and the integration with that.</b>

675
02:38:54,433 --> 02:38:57,500
<b>The agent-agent kind of platform too,</b>

676
02:38:57,500 --> 02:38:59,333
<b>for how agents are going to communicate with each other,</b>

677
02:38:59,566 --> 02:39:00,633
<b>that kind of standard.</b>

678
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:03,933
<b>And then of course the agent meets</b>

679
02:39:04,833 --> 02:39:06,000
<b>software developer kit too.</b>

680
02:39:06,799 --> 02:39:10,133
<b>So I've kind of been working off that plan,</b>

681
02:39:10,133 --> 02:39:11,533
<b>I've been building off of that plan,</b>

682
02:39:12,333 --> 02:39:14,766
<b>the one that was formulated on November 13th,</b>

683
02:39:14,799 --> 02:39:16,033
<b>it's called the recovery plan.</b>

684
02:39:17,299 --> 02:39:18,799
<b>So I've been building off of that</b>

685
02:39:18,799 --> 02:39:21,299
<b>and making sure that the code is good, it doesn't bug.</b>

686
02:39:23,633 --> 02:39:24,833
<b>Been testing it, making sure</b>

687
02:39:24,833 --> 02:39:26,299
<b>that the Docker loads properly.</b>

688
02:39:29,033 --> 02:39:32,733
<b>But we really do need to formulate a blueprint</b>

689
02:39:33,299 --> 02:39:35,933
<b>for the contextual integrity score,</b>

690
02:39:35,933 --> 02:39:40,933
<b>because it has to be a rigorous formula.</b>

691
02:39:40,933 --> 02:39:43,433
<b>It has to contain logic,</b>

692
02:39:44,333 --> 02:39:47,399
<b>and it can't just be like a rubric how it's outlined now.</b>

693
02:39:47,833 --> 02:39:50,233
<b>So I wanted to kind of give an update and be like,</b>

694
02:39:50,233 --> 02:39:53,333
<b>well, I have to adapt the plan yet again</b>

695
02:39:53,333 --> 02:39:56,299
<b>to accommodate those proposed formulas.</b>

696
02:39:56,733 --> 02:39:59,966
<b>And then we can always tweak those formulas later on,</b>

697
02:40:00,333 --> 02:40:02,033
<b>but there has to be logic there initially</b>

698
02:40:02,033 --> 02:40:03,433
<b>for us to be able to work with.</b>

699
02:40:05,866 --> 02:40:08,500
<b>So that's kind of why I was hoping</b>

700
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:08,899
<b>that we could prioritize finalizing</b>

701
02:40:08,933 --> 02:40:11,433
<b>the research paper revisions.</b>

702
02:40:12,466 --> 02:40:16,399
<b>I'm not gonna do any copywriting or stuff anymore.</b>

703
02:40:16,399 --> 02:40:18,000
<b>It was suggested to me that I copyrighted</b>

704
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,533
<b>like this initial paper that I created,</b>

705
02:40:20,799 --> 02:40:24,799
<b>but it's honestly just all AI generated.</b>

706
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:27,033
<b>The idea is valuable,</b>

707
02:40:27,033 --> 02:40:30,066
<b>but I don't think we have to copyright anything right now.</b>

708
02:40:30,933 --> 02:40:32,433
<b>Also, I've never written a</b>

709
02:40:32,433 --> 02:40:33,933
<b>research paper or anything before,</b>

710
02:40:33,933 --> 02:40:36,399
<b>so I could honestly really use your guys' advice</b>

711
02:40:36,399 --> 02:40:36,533
<b>from an academic standpoint,</b>

712
02:40:36,566 --> 02:40:40,299
<b>because I don't know the formal process for this.</b>

713
02:40:40,933 --> 02:40:42,600
<b>But yeah, we do need to revise the paper</b>

714
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:44,100
<b>and kind of come to an understanding</b>

715
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:48,333
<b>of whether it's consistent and it's logic.</b>

716
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,466
<b>So I'm going to create a Discord server</b>

717
02:40:52,633 --> 02:40:55,899
<b>and kind of put some key documents in there</b>

718
02:40:56,399 --> 02:40:58,933
<b>when it comes to revising the research paper</b>

719
02:40:58,933 --> 02:41:02,266
<b>and kind of explain what documentation we already have.</b>

720
02:41:03,399 --> 02:41:04,766
<b>Of course, everything that it's referenced in that paper,</b>

721
02:41:04,799 --> 02:41:07,600
<b>it's available in those documents.</b>

722
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:09,000
<b>So you can kind of rabbit hole.</b>

723
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,133
<b>You can see where claims are referencing</b>

724
02:41:11,133 --> 02:41:12,700
<b>other research papers and all that.</b>

725
02:41:15,433 --> 02:41:21,399
<b>And then when it comes to the workshop,</b>

726
02:41:21,966 --> 02:41:24,100
<b>everything, so the foundation is set, okay?</b>

727
02:41:24,100 --> 02:41:25,933
<b>The foundation is set in this repository.</b>

728
02:41:26,633 --> 02:41:27,733
<b>Everything is just waiting for</b>

729
02:41:27,733 --> 02:41:29,000
<b>those mathematical blueprints.</b>

730
02:41:29,799 --> 02:41:32,200
<b>So that's gonna be the tricky stuff, especially for me.</b>

731
02:41:32,866 --> 02:41:35,466
<b>But I think we can do it.</b>

732
02:41:35,466 --> 02:41:37,633
<b>I think we can come to an understanding with it.</b>

733
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:43,399
<b>All of that document that I shared in the Google Meet chat,</b>

734
02:41:44,866 --> 02:41:49,966
<b>that was generated by Google Gemini to propose an example.</b>

735
02:41:51,133 --> 02:41:53,200
<b>So I think what we can do is we can take that logic</b>

736
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:54,600
<b>and use it as kind of a baseline,</b>

737
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,899
<b>come to understand what it's talking about</b>

738
02:41:56,899 --> 02:42:00,799
<b>and what it means, and see if it would be a safe thing</b>

739
02:42:01,066 --> 02:42:04,433
<b>to apply into what we're building</b>

740
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:07,966
<b>once we have a good understanding of what it's doing.</b>

741
02:42:10,266 --> 02:42:13,033
<b>When it comes to the multi-agent system,</b>

742
02:42:13,033 --> 02:42:14,700
<b>there's kind of like an orchestrator</b>

743
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:17,333
<b>delegating to worker structure there</b>

744
02:42:17,333 --> 02:42:19,899
<b>that exists in the code base.</b>

745
02:42:20,433 --> 02:42:22,700
<b>I think we need to just verify that the logic's good there,</b>

746
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:24,299
<b>but I think that's much simpler stuff.</b>

747
02:42:27,399 --> 02:42:28,899
<b>And of course, there's also prototypes for the logic too,</b>

748
02:42:28,933 --> 02:42:29,899
<b>I think.</b>

749
02:42:32,799 --> 02:42:34,433
<b>So yeah, I just wanted to make sure</b>

750
02:42:34,433 --> 02:42:38,533
<b>that we were kind of on the same page</b>

751
02:42:38,533 --> 02:42:41,233
<b>when it comes to pivoting of the plan,</b>

752
02:42:41,233 --> 02:42:43,700
<b>because I'm sure you guys have noticed the plan is kind of,</b>

753
02:42:44,366 --> 02:42:47,266
<b>it's consistent in the documents that it's consistent,</b>

754
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:50,299
<b>but right now it needs to be consolidated.</b>

755
02:42:51,133 --> 02:42:53,100
<b>And the first step to that would be consolidating</b>

756
02:42:53,100 --> 02:42:56,133
<b>the research paper and updating it to make sure</b>

757
02:42:56,166 --> 02:42:57,399
<b>that it goes into specifics</b>

758
02:42:57,399 --> 02:42:59,200
<b>and proposed mathematical formulas.</b>

759
02:42:59,833 --> 02:43:01,166
<b>And then we can adapt the plan</b>

760
02:43:01,166 --> 02:43:03,200
<b>to mirror the research paper.</b>

761
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:06,633
<b>That's pretty much as simple as I can get things.</b>

762
02:43:08,299 --> 02:43:11,633
<b>And then after that, we really just have to carry out</b>

763
02:43:11,633 --> 02:43:16,399
<b>the plan and make sure that the code passes the test</b>

764
02:43:16,399 --> 02:43:18,333
<b>to make sure that there's proper test structured</b>

765
02:43:19,033 --> 02:43:20,066
<b>to evaluate the code,</b>

766
02:43:20,299 --> 02:43:22,433
<b>and then everything should flow from there.</b>

767
02:43:22,899 --> 02:43:25,733
<b>So right now we're basically just forming</b>

768
02:43:25,899 --> 02:43:28,733
<b>the final foundation of the logic of the project,</b>

769
02:43:28,933 --> 02:43:31,566
<b>which is those math formulas that I was talking about.</b>

770
02:43:32,466 --> 02:43:35,233
<b>And then we should be good to go to start building.</b>

771
02:43:36,433 --> 02:43:37,700
<b>Does that kind of make sense?</b>

772
02:43:40,733 --> 02:43:42,433
<b>Do we have a good consensus on that?</b>

773
02:43:45,066 --> 02:43:47,333
<b>To be honest, I feel like I'm kind of a little bit</b>

774
02:43:48,433 --> 02:43:51,700
<b>behind the page or the plan,</b>

775
02:43:51,833 --> 02:43:54,833
<b>because I think you guys already worked together</b>

776
02:43:54,833 --> 02:43:55,666
<b>for a while, right?</b>

777
02:43:56,933 --> 02:44:01,399
<b>And I don't know, because I just checked the GitHub</b>

778
02:44:01,533 --> 02:44:03,166
<b>actually today a little bit,</b>

779
02:44:03,166 --> 02:44:05,633
<b>so not really deep dive in all the section</b>

780
02:44:05,633 --> 02:44:06,433
<b>and all the papers.</b>

781
02:44:07,533 --> 02:44:10,500
<b>Is there any already kind of a detailed plan</b>

782
02:44:10,500 --> 02:44:13,933
<b>or who is doing what or like toward the project?</b>

783
02:44:17,799 --> 02:44:18,633
<b>Honestly, no.</b>

784
02:44:18,666 --> 02:44:23,033
<b>This is the first time we've come together</b>

785
02:44:23,033 --> 02:44:23,866
<b>to meet as a group.</b>

786
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:28,233
<b>I kind of just built out this foundation of the project</b>

787
02:44:28,233 --> 02:44:31,200
<b>in my spare time.</b>

788
02:44:33,533 --> 02:44:35,233
<b>So when it comes to the role,</b>

789
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:38,500
<b>I think here's what we should do.</b>

790
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:40,399
<b>I think we should start with what we know.</b>

791
02:44:40,799 --> 02:44:42,000
<b>So anytime you recognize--</b>

792
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,700
<b>Sorry, have you looked at the project plan?</b>

793
02:44:44,133 --> 02:44:47,833
<b>There is a skeletal organization that he made there.</b>

794
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:51,299
<b>I think that's good, starts you off.</b>

795
02:44:51,833 --> 02:44:53,700
<b>Here, Garrett, let me send you...</b>

796
02:44:54,866 --> 02:44:57,299
<b>So there's the document that I</b>

797
02:44:57,299 --> 02:44:58,299
<b>think that you should look at</b>

798
02:44:58,299 --> 02:45:00,133
<b>is called the strategic master log.</b>

799
02:45:00,133 --> 02:45:03,166
<b>And I'm gonna send that to you in the Google Meet chat.</b>

800
02:45:05,633 --> 02:45:10,633
<b>And it's basically a bird's eye view of the documentation</b>

801
02:45:11,399 --> 02:45:12,933
<b>and its structure in the repository.</b>

802
02:45:14,466 --> 02:45:19,200
<b>And it gives kind of like a very simple explanation</b>

803
02:45:19,533 --> 02:45:21,066
<b>of each document.</b>

804
02:45:22,233 --> 02:45:24,799
<b>And what I'm going to do this next week is kind of just</b>

805
02:45:27,399 --> 02:45:31,933
<b>come up with a plan on how to consolidate all of that.</b>

806
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:34,899
<b>Because everything's in all of these different locations.</b>

807
02:45:35,433 --> 02:45:36,466
<b>Everything's timestamped,</b>

808
02:45:36,466 --> 02:45:38,066
<b>so you can tell when everything was created.</b>

809
02:45:39,466 --> 02:45:41,200
<b>But honestly, I agree with Garrett.</b>

810
02:45:41,866 --> 02:45:43,600
<b>It's all the documentation.</b>

811
02:45:43,866 --> 02:45:46,333
<b>It may be consistent and it may be evolving,</b>

812
02:45:46,633 --> 02:45:48,933
<b>but it's all over the place in the repository.</b>

813
02:45:50,033 --> 02:45:51,799
<b>And it's confusing.</b>

814
02:45:52,133 --> 02:45:53,700
<b>It's confusing even for me.</b>

815
02:45:54,033 --> 02:45:56,100
<b>I'm barely able to hold it all together myself.</b>

816
02:45:56,600 --> 02:45:59,600
<b>So like I said, I think it's</b>

817
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:00,799
<b>good that we're kind of getting</b>

818
02:46:00,799 --> 02:46:02,299
<b>this confusion out here in the open,</b>

819
02:46:02,333 --> 02:46:05,633
<b>because it's just a little hill that we're gonna get over.</b>

820
02:46:06,133 --> 02:46:07,399
<b>I'm sorry, I'm talking too much.</b>

821
02:46:07,399 --> 02:46:08,299
<b>I have to share the link.</b>

822
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:10,933
<b>Yeah, it's okay.</b>

823
02:46:12,433 --> 02:46:17,299
<b>I also created, this is something that helped me</b>

824
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:19,733
<b>and just see everything like a little nicer.</b>

825
02:46:20,233 --> 02:46:23,500
<b>I created a, it's under a branch called feed slash docs.</b>

826
02:46:24,466 --> 02:46:25,366
<b>You guys can take a look.</b>

827
02:46:25,366 --> 02:46:28,233
<b>Basically it just adds a docs for an onboarding folder</b>

828
02:46:28,633 --> 02:46:30,000
<b>with like a HTML file.</b>

829
02:46:30,666 --> 02:46:35,233
<b>I just prefer looking at that than a Markdown file.</b>

830
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:37,399
<b>HTML file with like all the links.</b>

831
02:46:37,433 --> 02:46:38,933
<b>It's basically the master log,</b>

832
02:46:38,933 --> 02:46:41,433
<b>but with like links and summaries to each thing.</b>

833
02:46:42,033 --> 02:46:44,566
<b>So it just helped me like kind of understand</b>

834
02:46:44,866 --> 02:46:46,133
<b>the interconnections faster.</b>

835
02:46:46,866 --> 02:46:50,033
<b>Yeah, so you guys can take a look at that as well.</b>

836
02:46:50,433 --> 02:46:51,299
<b>Yeah, basically just--</b>

837
02:46:51,799 --> 02:46:53,133
<b>Sorry, where can I find that again?</b>

838
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:54,833
<b>Yeah, so there's a branch.</b>

839
02:46:55,700 --> 02:46:56,799
<b>I hope I pushed it.</b>

840
02:46:56,833 --> 02:46:59,299
<b>Oh, I actually, I merged it with the master branch today.</b>

841
02:46:59,533 --> 02:47:00,733
<b>So we're using the master now.</b>

842
02:47:01,266 --> 02:47:03,399
<b>Yeah, it's just an onboarding folder.</b>

843
02:47:04,033 --> 02:47:05,600
<b>Yeah, onboard, yeah, yeah, yeah, here it is.</b>

844
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:06,533
<b>It's in the root folder.</b>

845
02:47:06,899 --> 02:47:10,666
<b>Just open the index.html, then there's like summaries</b>

846
02:47:10,666 --> 02:47:11,200
<b>and links.</b>

847
02:47:11,866 --> 02:47:13,500
<b>It might have missed like maybe some stuff,</b>

848
02:47:13,500 --> 02:47:16,533
<b>but like I think it's helpful just to really quickly get</b>

849
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:19,500
<b>onboarded, what's what's been happening.</b>

850
02:47:20,399 --> 02:47:22,833
<b>Yeah, it's just basic should be the same thing</b>

851
02:47:22,833 --> 02:47:25,833
<b>as like the Markdown just like, just prettier.</b>

852
02:47:27,133 --> 02:47:29,133
<b>Yeah, so I think that helped me get onboard.</b>

853
02:47:29,766 --> 02:47:32,133
<b>I actually only looked at a repository yesterday as well,</b>

854
02:47:33,133 --> 02:47:34,033
<b>because I just got access,</b>

855
02:47:34,533 --> 02:47:36,799
<b>but that helped me like kind of understand a little bit</b>

856
02:47:36,799 --> 02:47:39,233
<b>of like the history and what's been going on.</b>

857
02:47:39,333 --> 02:47:40,033
<b>Yeah. Oh, here,</b>

858
02:47:40,033 --> 02:47:41,566
<b>I'll share my screen and we can also--</b>

859
02:47:42,066 --> 02:47:43,500
<b>Which one is that, Samuel?</b>

860
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:45,000
<b>Is it in onboarding folder?</b>

861
02:47:45,899 --> 02:47:48,533
<b>Yes, and then just open the index.html in your browser.</b>

862
02:47:49,833 --> 02:47:51,333
<b>And then you can click into the front stuff.</b>

863
02:47:52,133 --> 02:47:52,899
<b>Okay, thank you. Yeah.</b>

864
02:47:52,899 --> 02:47:53,333
<b>Here we go.</b>

865
02:47:54,933 --> 02:47:56,566
<b>Oh, okay, thank you. Yeah, so this is it.</b>

866
02:47:56,566 --> 02:47:57,433
<b>This is really nice.</b>

867
02:47:58,299 --> 02:47:59,399
<b>Yeah, and then if you scroll down,</b>

868
02:47:59,399 --> 02:48:03,299
<b>there's like links to each different kind of summaries</b>

869
02:48:03,433 --> 02:48:05,899
<b>of each document, and if you want, you can type in.</b>

870
02:48:06,666 --> 02:48:07,933
<b>Oh, this is perfect. So you just--</b>

871
02:48:08,299 --> 02:48:09,833
<b>Thank you. Yeah, yeah.</b>

872
02:48:12,633 --> 02:48:14,433
<b>This is so good. I'm onboarding.</b>

873
02:48:14,733 --> 02:48:15,899
<b>We should have started with this.</b>

874
02:48:18,633 --> 02:48:18,766
<b>(laughing)</b>

875
02:48:21,933 --> 02:48:25,100
<b>Okay, yeah, I'm hoping this is gonna clear stuff up too.</b>

876
02:48:27,233 --> 02:48:31,933
<b>Yeah, I really appreciate you guys bearing with this,</b>

877
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:34,000
<b>because I know it's kind of a big undertaking.</b>

878
02:48:34,433 --> 02:48:35,733
<b>It's a lot to take in.</b>

879
02:48:37,333 --> 02:48:39,233
<b>But I think as soon as we figure out</b>

880
02:48:40,266 --> 02:48:47,133
<b>how to incorporate the logic that's in the research folders</b>

881
02:48:47,700 --> 02:48:49,066
<b>of the documentation folder,</b>

882
02:48:50,833 --> 02:48:54,433
<b>as soon as we incorporate that into a consistent document,</b>

883
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:58,700
<b>and then we can be ready to incorporate that document</b>

884
02:49:00,299 --> 02:49:02,133
<b>and adjust the plan.</b>

885
02:49:02,433 --> 02:49:07,033
<b>So what I typically do is whenever I create a plan</b>

886
02:49:07,033 --> 02:49:09,066
<b>for coding anything in the repository,</b>

887
02:49:10,066 --> 02:49:12,533
<b>I come up with a high level idea, and I take that idea,</b>

888
02:49:12,799 --> 02:49:15,466
<b>and I come up with a gap analysis.</b>

889
02:49:15,899 --> 02:49:18,133
<b>And I usually take an AI agent,</b>

890
02:49:18,133 --> 02:49:24,600
<b>and I prompt it to review all of the core foundational code</b>

891
02:49:25,233 --> 02:49:27,766
<b>in the repository and compare it to the plan</b>

892
02:49:28,100 --> 02:49:28,766
<b>that I have in mind.</b>

893
02:49:29,399 --> 02:49:32,133
<b>And I have a come up with a gap analysis document.</b>

894
02:49:32,633 --> 02:49:35,366
<b>So it usually tells me where things connect,</b>

895
02:49:35,366 --> 02:49:36,933
<b>where things are already formed and created,</b>

896
02:49:37,533 --> 02:49:39,133
<b>where things contradict each other</b>

897
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:41,399
<b>from the plan that I want to implement</b>

898
02:49:41,700 --> 02:49:43,899
<b>into what I'm building compared to what exists.</b>

899
02:49:45,100 --> 02:49:48,899
<b>So when I come up with further research</b>

900
02:49:49,066 --> 02:49:51,299
<b>that comes up with math functions</b>

901
02:49:51,533 --> 02:49:53,333
<b>for the contextual integrity score,</b>

902
02:49:53,899 --> 02:49:55,533
<b>and it comes up with all of this logic,</b>

903
02:49:56,933 --> 02:49:59,033
<b>the logic itself may be consistent,</b>

904
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:03,433
<b>and it may fit well into the high level view of the plan.</b>

905
02:50:04,399 --> 02:50:06,666
<b>But when it comes to the,</b>

906
02:50:06,933 --> 02:50:09,200
<b>if you go to section three of the navigation guide,</b>

907
02:50:10,533 --> 02:50:14,733
<b>you'll find, I'm sorry, section two of the website.</b>

908
02:50:14,733 --> 02:50:16,933
<b>Is everybody on the HTML page,</b>

909
02:50:16,933 --> 02:50:18,299
<b>or can they at least see my screen?</b>

910
02:50:20,600 --> 02:50:20,933
<b>Yeah.</b>

911
02:50:21,500 --> 02:50:21,700
<b>Okay.</b>

912
02:50:21,700 --> 02:50:22,399
<b>Okay, screen now.</b>

913
02:50:22,766 --> 02:50:24,166
<b>Right, so if we go to section two,</b>

914
02:50:24,433 --> 02:50:26,933
<b>here's the workshop, the historical technical plan, right?</b>

915
02:50:27,533 --> 02:50:30,100
<b>We have this thing titled the recovery plan.</b>

916
02:50:30,799 --> 02:50:33,700
<b>This is a plan that I've created from a gap analysis</b>

917
02:50:35,200 --> 02:50:40,100
<b>between a very large research document of previous</b>

918
02:50:40,899 --> 02:50:43,966
<b>and current agent beats guidelines rules,</b>

919
02:50:45,133 --> 02:50:49,299
<b>kind of implied rules in terms of like sponsorships</b>

920
02:50:49,299 --> 02:50:49,866
<b>and all that.</b>

921
02:50:50,333 --> 02:50:52,633
<b>So I came up with this plan earlier</b>

922
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:56,600
<b>about almost 10 days ago on the 13th.</b>

923
02:50:56,600 --> 02:50:58,466
<b>And I started enacting that plan</b>

924
02:51:00,433 --> 02:51:02,033
<b>and putting it into the code base.</b>

925
02:51:02,433 --> 02:51:05,266
<b>And I stopped at a certain point of the plan.</b>

926
02:51:06,333 --> 02:51:08,833
<b>And then I started realizing, yeah, there's no logic</b>

927
02:51:09,066 --> 02:51:11,200
<b>in how we're actually going to evaluate</b>

928
02:51:11,700 --> 02:51:13,233
<b>with the contextual integrity score.</b>

929
02:51:13,933 --> 02:51:15,600
<b>When I met with Deep D last week,</b>

930
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:16,633
<b>she kind of brought that up.</b>

931
02:51:16,633 --> 02:51:19,466
<b>She was like, well, how are we going to structure</b>

932
02:51:19,866 --> 02:51:23,166
<b>each pillar of the contextual integrity score?</b>

933
02:51:23,166 --> 02:51:24,966
<b>Like what tools are we going to use?</b>

934
02:51:24,966 --> 02:51:26,033
<b>What logic are we going to use?</b>

935
02:51:26,033 --> 02:51:27,299
<b>And I was like, wow, that's a good question.</b>

936
02:51:27,866 --> 02:51:30,500
<b>Because everything in that is still high level.</b>

937
02:51:30,500 --> 02:51:33,366
<b>It hasn't been cut out into logic yet.</b>

938
02:51:33,733 --> 02:51:37,700
<b>So I went and I came up with some logic using AI</b>

939
02:51:38,233 --> 02:51:39,899
<b>and AI proposed some stuff to me.</b>

940
02:51:40,399 --> 02:51:42,600
<b>That's that really complicated document</b>

941
02:51:42,600 --> 02:51:43,733
<b>that I shared with you guys</b>

942
02:51:43,733 --> 02:51:47,333
<b>like 20 minutes ago, that GitHub.</b>

943
02:51:48,133 --> 02:51:54,433
<b>It's called the 20251118 proposed section 2.2.md.</b>

944
02:51:54,733 --> 02:51:58,466
<b>That link, it's basically eligible for me.</b>

945
02:52:00,299 --> 02:52:03,399
<b>So what I need to do, and that's in the,</b>

946
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:10,000
<b>you can find that in the cutting edge section,</b>

947
02:52:10,833 --> 02:52:11,700
<b>strategic pivots.</b>

948
02:52:12,333 --> 02:52:13,566
<b>That's where all the research is.</b>

949
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:17,700
<b>So if you want to see like research that goes deeper</b>

950
02:52:17,833 --> 02:52:22,399
<b>into the base level ideas, you go to the docs folder,</b>

951
02:52:22,399 --> 02:52:25,299
<b>you go to the strategy and IP folder within that,</b>

952
02:52:25,566 --> 02:52:27,733
<b>and then you'll find some papers.</b>

953
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:31,366
<b>And those papers get into more detailed logic.</b>

954
02:52:32,100 --> 02:52:36,033
<b>So that logic has not been incorporated into the plan yet.</b>

955
02:52:36,566 --> 02:52:38,466
<b>So what I have to do this</b>

956
02:52:38,466 --> 02:52:40,133
<b>upcoming week is I have to come up</b>

957
02:52:40,133 --> 02:52:41,933
<b>with another gap analysis.</b>

958
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:45,500
<b>I have to analyze the entire state of the current state</b>

959
02:52:45,500 --> 02:52:47,333
<b>of the repository, which is well-documented.</b>

960
02:52:47,733 --> 02:52:49,899
<b>It's been rigorously tested and reviewed.</b>

961
02:52:50,633 --> 02:52:52,866
<b>I have to do the same thing for the recovery plan,</b>

962
02:52:52,866 --> 02:52:54,000
<b>which was on the 13th.</b>

963
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:54,933
<b>That's in section two.</b>

964
02:52:55,233 --> 02:52:56,866
<b>That's the plan that I was carrying out.</b>

965
02:52:58,333 --> 02:53:00,833
<b>And then I have to figure out where the gaps are</b>

966
02:53:00,833 --> 02:53:02,966
<b>and whether there's contradictions in the plan</b>

967
02:53:03,399 --> 02:53:08,399
<b>compared to the proposed logic that's been discovered.</b>

968
02:53:09,233 --> 02:53:14,500
<b>And then the strategic pivot plan is highlighted</b>

969
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:15,666
<b>in section three.</b>

970
02:53:17,700 --> 02:53:20,433
<b>It's basically just trying to figure out how we can</b>

971
02:53:20,433 --> 02:53:22,200
<b>incorporate that into the current plan.</b>

972
02:53:22,899 --> 02:53:24,366
<b>And it shouldn't be too hard.</b>

973
02:53:24,566 --> 02:53:26,100
<b>I think we all just need to take on roles</b>

974
02:53:26,100 --> 02:53:30,899
<b>of what we're most familiar with in terms of these plans.</b>

975
02:53:32,100 --> 02:53:33,366
<b>Definitely pick your strengths.</b>

976
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:38,033
<b>My strength is organization and comparing whether documents</b>

977
02:53:38,433 --> 02:53:41,100
<b>are relevant to each other, whether ideas align</b>

978
02:53:41,100 --> 02:53:43,299
<b>with each other, where they contradict, where they differ.</b>

979
02:53:44,200 --> 02:53:45,833
<b>So I'm good at that high level stuff.</b>

980
02:53:46,399 --> 02:53:50,666
<b>If you guys find terms or anything that kind of peak out</b>

981
02:53:50,666 --> 02:53:53,033
<b>to you that you have personal experience with,</b>

982
02:53:53,533 --> 02:53:55,533
<b>focus on those and present your findings</b>

983
02:53:56,899 --> 02:53:58,866
<b>in a form that best suits you.</b>

984
02:53:58,866 --> 02:54:02,966
<b>You can either, when I create our group Discord server,</b>

985
02:54:03,399 --> 02:54:05,166
<b>you can either just put it straight in the Discord server</b>

986
02:54:05,399 --> 02:54:08,200
<b>and I can format it into log documents</b>

987
02:54:08,533 --> 02:54:09,966
<b>and put those into the repository.</b>

988
02:54:10,799 --> 02:54:12,200
<b>Or you can create your own evaluation</b>

989
02:54:12,500 --> 02:54:13,766
<b>and you can create your own findings.</b>

990
02:54:14,466 --> 02:54:15,799
<b>You can create your own subfolder</b>

991
02:54:15,799 --> 02:54:18,200
<b>in the logs folder of the repository.</b>

992
02:54:18,566 --> 02:54:21,566
<b>And you can use that just for your own needs</b>

993
02:54:21,566 --> 02:54:22,799
<b>and organize it how you want.</b>

994
02:54:23,799 --> 02:54:27,533
<b>So that less of your time is spent trying to understand</b>

995
02:54:27,533 --> 02:54:28,733
<b>how to fit the form at it.</b>

996
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:31,633
<b>So when you guys kind of review this,</b>

997
02:54:32,100 --> 02:54:33,500
<b>if you guys need to take personal notes</b>

998
02:54:33,666 --> 02:54:34,700
<b>and put it in the repository,</b>

999
02:54:35,299 --> 02:54:37,533
<b>just make your own folder wherever you wanna make it</b>

1000
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:43,000
<b>and tell me so that I can make sure that that's clear</b>

1001
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:43,933
<b>where to find your stuff.</b>

1002
02:54:45,866 --> 02:54:48,833
<b>I know this is like a really general kind of suggestion</b>

1003
02:54:49,133 --> 02:54:51,966
<b>that I'm making right now, but it works</b>

1004
02:54:52,333 --> 02:54:55,166
<b>because we can always kind of connect our findings together</b>

1005
02:54:55,666 --> 02:54:58,033
<b>in these weekly meetings and</b>

1006
02:54:58,033 --> 02:55:00,633
<b>through our group messages too.</b>

1007
02:55:00,833 --> 02:55:07,233
<b>So yeah, we basically need to just put things together.</b>

1008
02:55:07,533 --> 02:55:09,966
<b>Ideas are consistent in all these different sections</b>

1009
02:55:09,966 --> 02:55:13,466
<b>of the repository, but the logic that's been recently</b>

1010
02:55:13,466 --> 02:55:14,866
<b>discovered on how to organize</b>

1011
02:55:14,866 --> 02:55:17,100
<b>the contextual integrity best score,</b>

1012
02:55:17,799 --> 02:55:20,833
<b>that needs to be incorporated into the current plan</b>

1013
02:55:21,366 --> 02:55:23,566
<b>that the repository has been based off of</b>

1014
02:55:23,566 --> 02:55:25,133
<b>so that when we continue to work,</b>

1015
02:55:25,666 --> 02:55:26,666
<b>we're making sure that we have specific logic</b>

1016
02:55:26,933 --> 02:55:31,333
<b>for each way that we're taking our evaluation.</b>

1017
02:55:33,899 --> 02:55:37,799
<b>I'm hoping that that kind of provides an explanation.</b>

1018
02:55:39,100 --> 02:55:42,266
<b>You can always continue to ask me questions about it</b>

1019
02:55:42,266 --> 02:55:46,799
<b>and it's my fault that the documentation is so crazy.</b>

1020
02:55:47,833 --> 02:55:49,633
<b>So I'm going to spend this next week</b>

1021
02:55:49,633 --> 02:55:51,933
<b>kind of just helping take that on.</b>

1022
02:55:51,933 --> 02:55:58,200
<b>But yeah, if like my top recommendation is definitely</b>

1023
02:55:58,200 --> 02:56:00,533
<b>take a look at the current plan</b>

1024
02:56:00,533 --> 02:56:04,666
<b>that just has the high level stuff in it, right?</b>

1025
02:56:04,666 --> 02:56:08,433
<b>That's the one that was created on the 13th, section two,</b>

1026
02:56:08,766 --> 02:56:11,100
<b>right, that's the historical technical plan.</b>

1027
02:56:13,100 --> 02:56:16,133
<b>I've updated the code base up to task 1.2 of that plan.</b>

1028
02:56:16,799 --> 02:56:19,533
<b>So that may not be completely clear,</b>

1029
02:56:19,533 --> 02:56:20,633
<b>but you can find in the logs folder</b>

1030
02:56:21,100 --> 02:56:24,200
<b>under my co-pilot subfolder</b>

1031
02:56:24,200 --> 02:56:27,200
<b>that I've completed task 1.2 of this plan.</b>

1032
02:56:29,899 --> 02:56:36,333
<b>But where the logic deviates is currently unknown.</b>

1033
02:56:36,733 --> 02:56:40,433
<b>So I do have a gap analysis I think that currently exists,</b>

1034
02:56:40,899 --> 02:56:44,000
<b>but yeah, so I recommend like this upcoming week,</b>

1035
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:47,500
<b>just try and understand each aspect of the repository.</b>

1036
02:56:47,933 --> 02:56:52,000
<b>The documents or the documentation</b>

1037
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:55,666
<b>are as accurate as I can make it.</b>

1038
02:56:57,366 --> 02:56:59,133
<b>Also try and run the code too.</b>

1039
02:56:59,133 --> 02:57:01,533
<b>Try and use the readme file in the folder</b>

1040
02:57:01,533 --> 02:57:04,266
<b>to just see if you're able to install</b>

1041
02:57:04,266 --> 02:57:05,700
<b>all the modules on your computer.</b>

1042
02:57:06,033 --> 02:57:09,633
<b>You'll have to install Visual Studio Code.</b>

1043
02:57:09,633 --> 02:57:11,466
<b>It's all the instructions are outlined in the readme</b>

1044
02:57:11,466 --> 02:57:13,600
<b>for just setting up the code base itself.</b>

1045
02:57:14,666 --> 02:57:15,666
<b>So that should be too difficult.</b>

1046
02:57:15,666 --> 02:57:22,866
<b>If you guys run into issues with it, please tell me and yeah,</b>

1047
02:57:22,866 --> 02:57:25,266
<b>I'm just gonna open it up to further questions</b>

1048
02:57:25,266 --> 02:57:26,200
<b>and comments now,</b>

1049
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:28,433
<b>because I feel like I've been talking for too long.</b>

1050
02:57:28,733 --> 02:57:28,933
<b>So.</b>

1051
02:57:36,500 --> 02:57:38,399
<b>Yeah, thanks Josh.</b>

1052
02:57:38,833 --> 02:57:39,866
<b>Thanks, Sansu.</b>

1053
02:57:39,866 --> 02:57:42,833
<b>Yeah, I really need to go through the plan</b>

1054
02:57:42,833 --> 02:57:45,933
<b>and all the stuff and try to run it by myself. So I think that's a good question. And all the stuff and try to run it by myself first</b>

1055
02:57:45,933 --> 02:57:49,033
<b>so that I can understood or understand</b>

1056
02:57:49,433 --> 02:57:55,366
<b>how exactly it works and then to give my output there.</b>

1057
02:57:56,899 --> 02:57:57,166
<b>Sure.</b>

1058
02:57:58,399 --> 02:58:01,233
<b>And I, like I said, I know this is a lot to take in.</b>

1059
02:58:01,233 --> 02:58:02,333
<b>It's okay to be confused.</b>

1060
02:58:04,500 --> 02:58:07,366
<b>It's really the way that we all work together</b>

1061
02:58:07,733 --> 02:58:09,266
<b>with our own understanding of the project</b>

1062
02:58:10,100 --> 02:58:13,200
<b>and how we specialize in our own areas of the project</b>

1063
02:58:13,666 --> 02:58:15,600
<b>and how this project is gonna develop well.</b>

1064
02:58:16,033 --> 02:58:18,133
<b>So don't worry if you don't understand everything,</b>

1065
02:58:18,433 --> 02:58:20,600
<b>just try and stick with what you know first,</b>

1066
02:58:20,600 --> 02:58:22,433
<b>find things that are recognizable for you</b>

1067
02:58:22,933 --> 02:58:24,733
<b>and make your own connections from there.</b>

1068
02:58:25,799 --> 02:58:28,433
<b>And that's probably gonna be the easiest way for you</b>

1069
02:58:28,433 --> 02:58:31,233
<b>to kind of discover how our project.</b>

1070
02:58:33,733 --> 02:58:36,466
<b>But yeah, I'm really, dude,</b>

1071
02:58:36,700 --> 02:58:39,000
<b>Samuel, thank you again for making this website</b>

1072
02:58:39,333 --> 02:58:43,633
<b>because it's just way more organized</b>

1073
02:58:43,899 --> 02:58:48,266
<b>than that Markdown file that I made.</b>

1074
02:58:48,266 --> 02:58:49,833
<b>I mean, you could just see where everything is.</b>

1075
02:58:49,833 --> 02:58:51,033
<b>The summaries help so much.</b>

1076
02:58:52,733 --> 02:58:53,899
<b>So I really appreciate that.</b>

1077
02:58:54,133 --> 02:58:55,066
<b>That was a huge help.</b>

1078
02:58:56,266 --> 02:58:57,766
<b>Did you do this in just one day?</b>

1079
02:58:59,600 --> 02:59:00,266
<b>Yeah, I did that.</b>

1080
02:59:01,733 --> 02:59:02,799
<b>(indistinct) Yeah.</b>

1081
02:59:05,233 --> 02:59:06,466
<b>So, okay.</b>

1082
02:59:06,899 --> 02:59:08,200
<b>I think I have a few questions.</b>

1083
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:12,200
<b>Actually it's mainly admin related and that's what's new.</b>

1084
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:15,399
<b>So I think that's a couple of things.</b>

1085
02:59:15,399 --> 02:59:16,200
<b>So it's really like,</b>

1086
02:59:16,200 --> 02:59:18,166
<b>is there a theme size limit for this hackathon?</b>

1087
02:59:19,066 --> 02:59:19,633
<b>I think that's one.</b>

1088
02:59:20,066 --> 02:59:21,233
<b>There is, it's eight people.</b>

1089
02:59:23,066 --> 02:59:23,533
<b>Okay, okay.</b>

1090
02:59:23,733 --> 02:59:24,666
<b>That's slightly interesting.</b>

1091
02:59:25,299 --> 02:59:26,833
<b>Okay, so that's the first question.</b>

1092
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:28,333
<b>The second question is,</b>

1093
02:59:29,466 --> 02:59:33,500
<b>I saw that there is some like,</b>

1094
02:59:35,766 --> 02:59:37,333
<b>I mean, there's some requirements for the hackathon.</b>

1095
02:59:37,833 --> 02:59:40,100
<b>I think, like creating a benchmark</b>

1096
02:59:40,500 --> 02:59:42,133
<b>or evaluating some region.</b>

1097
02:59:43,033 --> 02:59:45,633
<b>So specifically like kind of what,</b>

1098
02:59:46,299 --> 02:59:49,100
<b>what are we pushing for for the hackathon specifically?</b>

1099
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:50,500
<b>So if you don't have a,</b>

1100
02:59:50,500 --> 02:59:51,133
<b>if you ask them now,</b>

1101
02:59:51,133 --> 02:59:51,399
<b>just like,</b>

1102
02:59:51,799 --> 02:59:52,533
<b>(indistinct)</b>

1103
02:59:54,266 --> 02:59:55,166
<b>really into the hackathon,</b>

1104
02:59:55,399 --> 02:59:56,133
<b>I guess to be honest,</b>

1105
02:59:57,066 --> 02:59:58,100
<b>why is it we're pushing for now?</b>

1106
02:59:58,333 --> 03:00:00,500
<b>So that we can be very clear what we should optimize for.</b>

1107
03:00:00,866 --> 03:00:02,833
<b>Yeah, we will smash the second question.</b>

1108
03:00:04,933 --> 03:00:07,733
<b>Sorry, let me try and rephrase that.</b>

1109
03:00:07,733 --> 03:00:10,500
<b>So like you're asking what we're pushing for now,</b>

1110
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:11,899
<b>what we're hoping to have achieved</b>

1111
03:00:11,899 --> 03:00:14,366
<b>by the deadline of the green agent phase.</b>

1112
03:00:14,366 --> 03:00:15,000
<b>Is that what you're asking?</b>

1113
03:00:16,233 --> 03:00:16,766
<b>Exactly, yeah.</b>

1114
03:00:17,100 --> 03:00:17,666
<b>Okay, sweet.</b>

1115
03:00:20,100 --> 03:00:22,299
<b>So yeah,</b>

1116
03:00:22,299 --> 03:00:24,500
<b>cause you know the website that I created,</b>

1117
03:00:24,500 --> 03:00:26,799
<b>it's very generalized, right?</b>

1118
03:00:27,366 --> 03:00:28,633
<b>So here's what I'm hoping.</b>

1119
03:00:28,633 --> 03:00:31,566
<b>I'm hoping that our project,</b>

1120
03:00:31,866 --> 03:00:32,533
<b>first of all,</b>

1121
03:00:32,700 --> 03:00:33,933
<b>like let's start with baseline, right?</b>

1122
03:00:34,266 --> 03:00:38,000
<b>We want our project to be easy to install to,</b>

1123
03:00:39,299 --> 03:00:41,200
<b>so that's why I had the Docker,</b>

1124
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,333
<b>so that like all the packages are just in modules</b>

1125
03:00:44,333 --> 03:00:46,100
<b>are just easy to install, right?</b>

1126
03:00:47,766 --> 03:00:48,000
<b>Not,</b>

1127
03:00:49,866 --> 03:00:50,500
<b>what do you call it?</b>

1128
03:00:51,333 --> 03:00:53,566
<b>There's nothing gate kept about the project in the terms,</b>

1129
03:00:53,933 --> 03:00:56,333
<b>in the sense of everything that you need</b>

1130
03:00:56,333 --> 03:00:59,000
<b>to run the project is easily accessible.</b>

1131
03:00:59,700 --> 03:01:02,200
<b>I feel like I'm rephrasing what I just said.</b>

1132
03:01:03,233 --> 03:01:03,733
<b>Number three,</b>

1133
03:01:04,133 --> 03:01:06,366
<b>it has to follow the agent to agent protocol number four,</b>

1134
03:01:06,833 --> 03:01:08,533
<b>the contextual integrity score,</b>

1135
03:01:08,533 --> 03:01:10,933
<b>it has to be consistent in the sense that</b>

1136
03:01:11,766 --> 03:01:13,500
<b>when we evaluate the same code base,</b>

1137
03:01:13,899 --> 03:01:16,299
<b>I'm hoping that our end product is going to</b>

1138
03:01:17,466 --> 03:01:20,233
<b>provide a detailed scoring system</b>

1139
03:01:20,566 --> 03:01:21,633
<b>that can tell us what,</b>

1140
03:01:21,633 --> 03:01:25,200
<b>where exactly the code base that we're evaluating</b>

1141
03:01:25,500 --> 03:01:26,700
<b>or potentially,</b>

1142
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:29,766
<b>or the purple agent, I'm sorry,</b>

1143
03:01:30,033 --> 03:01:31,433
<b>the purple agent that we're evaluating,</b>

1144
03:01:32,600 --> 03:01:34,833
<b>where exactly it falls short in certain areas,</b>

1145
03:01:35,433 --> 03:01:37,799
<b>maybe in terms of like documentation</b>

1146
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:40,633
<b>or the logic behind the code,</b>

1147
03:01:41,066 --> 03:01:42,899
<b>so it has to be consistent, right?</b>

1148
03:01:43,299 --> 03:01:45,799
<b>So when we put something into the evaluation system,</b>

1149
03:01:46,200 --> 03:01:48,700
<b>we want to make sure that if we run it several times</b>

1150
03:01:48,700 --> 03:01:49,666
<b>on the same thing,</b>

1151
03:01:49,666 --> 03:01:51,799
<b>it's not going to spit out a bunch of different stuff.</b>

1152
03:01:52,633 --> 03:01:54,500
<b>I feel like that's kind of a simple goal,</b>

1153
03:01:55,966 --> 03:01:59,766
<b>but other than that, I feel like everything is,</b>

1154
03:02:00,733 --> 03:02:03,633
<b>would you feel like,</b>

1155
03:02:05,266 --> 03:02:06,399
<b>like for example, the,</b>

1156
03:02:07,600 --> 03:02:10,166
<b>like let's look at the recovery plan here, right?</b>

1157
03:02:14,600 --> 03:02:16,666
<b>Let's just skip it really quick, right?</b>

1158
03:02:17,399 --> 03:02:19,133
<b>So we have the core analyzer logic,</b>

1159
03:02:22,333 --> 03:02:27,366
<b>each part of the logic has to output valid complexity</b>

1160
03:02:27,799 --> 03:02:29,033
<b>and maintainability scores.</b>

1161
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:32,966
<b>So in terms of like maintaining</b>

1162
03:02:34,200 --> 03:02:35,399
<b>what I'm assuming is the code base,</b>

1163
03:02:36,133 --> 03:02:38,799
<b>it has to output, I'm sorry,</b>

1164
03:02:38,799 --> 03:02:40,766
<b>I'm starting to lose my train of thought here a little bit.</b>

1165
03:02:43,266 --> 03:02:46,633
<b>First of all, I know I don't have to answer your question,</b>

1166
03:02:46,633 --> 03:02:48,433
<b>but does it seem like I understood your question</b>

1167
03:02:48,433 --> 03:02:50,566
<b>in the first place in terms of like,</b>

1168
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:53,433
<b>so you're talking about our end vision, right?</b>

1169
03:02:53,966 --> 03:02:54,633
<b>For the green agent?</b>

1170
03:02:54,933 --> 03:02:55,133
<b>Yeah.</b>

1171
03:02:55,666 --> 03:02:55,866
<b>Okay.</b>

1172
03:02:56,600 --> 03:02:57,933
<b>So I think it's like,</b>

1173
03:02:58,799 --> 03:03:02,933
<b>would you say that there's kind of a gap in documentation</b>

1174
03:03:03,433 --> 03:03:06,133
<b>of like where our agent envision is?</b>

1175
03:03:06,633 --> 03:03:09,066
<b>Because, you know, I feel like there's some,</b>

1176
03:03:10,166 --> 03:03:11,000
<b>there's some like general</b>

1177
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,833
<b>visions for what our green agent is.</b>

1178
03:03:14,633 --> 03:03:16,233
<b>And you can kind of decipher it based on</b>

1179
03:03:16,500 --> 03:03:18,233
<b>what the recovery plan has us enact,</b>

1180
03:03:19,066 --> 03:03:21,299
<b>but you're saying that we should probably come up</b>

1181
03:03:21,299 --> 03:03:23,799
<b>with a document that envisions the green agent</b>

1182
03:03:23,799 --> 03:03:25,133
<b>on a more detailed level, right?</b>

1183
03:03:26,399 --> 03:03:29,899
<b>Yeah, I think my name is</b>

1184
03:03:29,899 --> 03:03:30,766
<b>actually missing a little bit more.</b>

1185
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:32,733
<b>So like there's nothing at the start of it,</b>

1186
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:33,533
<b>I think it's like here,</b>

1187
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:35,100
<b>I think that's quite a bit of focus</b>

1188
03:03:35,100 --> 03:03:36,299
<b>on creating a job smart.</b>

1189
03:03:37,299 --> 03:03:41,033
<b>So it's not just like creating an agent that does,</b>

1190
03:03:41,033 --> 03:03:43,733
<b>and it does balance and it adds,</b>

1191
03:03:43,733 --> 03:03:44,333
<b>but we need to,</b>

1192
03:03:46,133 --> 03:03:47,933
<b>and if any of you have a different understanding,</b>

1193
03:03:48,166 --> 03:03:48,799
<b>please keep with me.</b>

1194
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:51,833
<b>We need to create like a benchmark</b>

1195
03:03:52,066 --> 03:03:53,100
<b>that kind of can be really,</b>

1196
03:03:54,233 --> 03:03:57,633
<b>like different kind of,</b>

1197
03:03:57,633 --> 03:03:59,866
<b>like basically so that,</b>

1198
03:03:59,866 --> 03:04:01,933
<b>like what you mentioned, like you predicted the key,</b>

1199
03:04:01,933 --> 03:04:03,500
<b>but I just had to do a little bit more about</b>

1200
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:05,566
<b>like how we have to learn about building this,</b>

1201
03:04:05,566 --> 03:04:07,333
<b>but it's like, no, we're telling you.</b>

1202
03:04:07,733 --> 03:04:10,133
<b>So like, sorry, the content of like a benchmark here,</b>

1203
03:04:10,133 --> 03:04:11,000
<b>like it's like,</b>

1204
03:04:12,200 --> 03:04:16,399
<b>in, it's just so that like every time someone has a new,</b>

1205
03:04:16,399 --> 03:04:18,299
<b>at least like how every time there's a new LLM,</b>

1206
03:04:18,299 --> 03:04:19,866
<b>they're always saying that they are keeping the top score.</b>

1207
03:04:20,399 --> 03:04:22,666
<b>So the top scores is just in like different,</b>

1208
03:04:22,799 --> 03:04:23,533
<b>they're all different types.</b>

1209
03:04:23,533 --> 03:04:25,100
<b>So in our case, they will be like,</b>

1210
03:04:25,366 --> 03:04:27,766
<b>basically something that we can always make</b>

1211
03:04:27,766 --> 03:04:28,899
<b>not for the content,</b>

1212
03:04:28,966 --> 03:04:31,433
<b>but for like different use cases.</b>

1213
03:04:32,233 --> 03:04:32,433
<b>Yeah.</b>

1214
03:04:33,766 --> 03:04:35,600
<b>So you're talking like,</b>

1215
03:04:36,500 --> 03:04:41,966
<b>like baseline things that we can use to give to agents</b>

1216
03:04:42,533 --> 03:04:47,066
<b>in order to evaluate their output.</b>

1217
03:04:47,066 --> 03:04:47,899
<b>Is that what you're talking about?</b>

1218
03:04:49,633 --> 03:04:50,100
<b>Yes, correct.</b>

1219
03:04:50,933 --> 03:04:55,399
<b>So like an example is like,</b>

1220
03:04:56,433 --> 03:04:58,066
<b>for example, Gemini 3.0 just released</b>

1221
03:04:58,366 --> 03:05:00,166
<b>and then they're saying, oh, it's touching the benchmark.</b>

1222
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:04,166
<b>Or it's like, of course those things can always be king,</b>

1223
03:05:04,899 --> 03:05:06,466
<b>but it does give like a baseline understanding</b>

1224
03:05:06,466 --> 03:05:07,866
<b>of how good it can be said,</b>

1225
03:05:07,866 --> 03:05:10,266
<b>a specific class, let's say a software development,</b>

1226
03:05:10,933 --> 03:05:12,966
<b>that have three bench or software development.</b>

1227
03:05:13,433 --> 03:05:17,399
<b>That's a class that is commonly like very useful</b>

1228
03:05:17,399 --> 03:05:18,266
<b>for like coding agents,</b>

1229
03:05:19,133 --> 03:05:20,700
<b>like a Google Junes or whatever it is.</b>

1230
03:05:21,433 --> 03:05:24,100
<b>And similarly for us,</b>

1231
03:05:24,533 --> 03:05:27,133
<b>we wanna be able to evaluate the contextual integrity.</b>

1232
03:05:27,899 --> 03:05:31,066
<b>So we wanna kind of create a benchmark for that.</b>

1233
03:05:31,066 --> 03:05:32,366
<b>And this is my understanding of like,</b>

1234
03:05:32,366 --> 03:05:34,200
<b>what is the impact upon part of this</b>

1235
03:05:34,200 --> 03:05:35,299
<b>to the data system we've been on,</b>

1236
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:37,433
<b>which is like something that should be done.</b>

1237
03:05:37,566 --> 03:05:38,666
<b>And for our own use case,</b>

1238
03:05:39,299 --> 03:05:40,933
<b>as we like work on this agent,</b>

1239
03:05:41,700 --> 03:05:43,000
<b>and we evaluate like different elements,</b>

1240
03:05:43,233 --> 03:05:46,000
<b>like we can kind of see how well like different elements</b>

1241
03:05:46,633 --> 03:05:47,366
<b>work on this benchmark.</b>

1242
03:05:47,799 --> 03:05:48,899
<b>So I get them this one,</b>

1243
03:05:48,899 --> 03:05:50,533
<b>like different about map,</b>

1244
03:05:51,500 --> 03:05:53,533
<b>if that's all the panel, yeah.</b>

1245
03:05:53,933 --> 03:05:55,133
<b>That's good. Like how we get doing it.</b>

1246
03:05:55,399 --> 03:05:55,799
<b>Yeah, that's good.</b>

1247
03:05:56,033 --> 03:05:59,399
<b>Okay, well, since we're kind of coming out of this</b>

1248
03:05:59,766 --> 03:06:01,799
<b>with a bit of a cybersecurity angle,</b>

1249
03:06:01,799 --> 03:06:03,833
<b>I was thinking maybe we could come up</b>

1250
03:06:03,833 --> 03:06:08,466
<b>with a few benchmark ideas for like cybersecurity apps</b>

1251
03:06:08,733 --> 03:06:11,066
<b>or maybe I wanna say environments.</b>

1252
03:06:11,666 --> 03:06:13,600
<b>I don't have any specific ideas yet,</b>

1253
03:06:13,766 --> 03:06:16,833
<b>but I'm really glad that you brought that up.</b>

1254
03:06:17,700 --> 03:06:21,266
<b>Did you happen to have any ideas for that yet?</b>

1255
03:06:21,266 --> 03:06:22,899
<b>Or maybe we could set a time later</b>

1256
03:06:22,966 --> 03:06:25,866
<b>to kind of hone that a little bit.</b>

1257
03:06:26,200 --> 03:06:26,733
<b>Sure, yeah.</b>

1258
03:06:27,799 --> 03:06:30,133
<b>I think that is, sorry, yeah.</b>

1259
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:30,600
<b>Oh, sorry.</b>

1260
03:06:31,033 --> 03:06:32,033
<b>And then in terms of like</b>

1261
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:37,600
<b>how we present those baseline evaluation prompts</b>

1262
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:40,633
<b>would be, in terms of like,</b>

1263
03:06:41,733 --> 03:06:43,200
<b>okay, it's tough because it's like,</b>

1264
03:06:44,433 --> 03:06:45,700
<b>are you talking about like prompts</b>

1265
03:06:45,933 --> 03:06:47,100
<b>that we would give the out,</b>

1266
03:06:47,600 --> 03:06:50,866
<b>the proposed purple agent, right?</b>

1267
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:53,899
<b>We would give the purple agent prompts</b>

1268
03:06:53,899 --> 03:06:55,566
<b>that we've already pre-structured</b>

1269
03:06:56,066 --> 03:06:58,799
<b>that we would eventually use to see</b>

1270
03:06:58,799 --> 03:07:02,100
<b>if the agent has completed those tasks in a way</b>

1271
03:07:02,399 --> 03:07:04,500
<b>that doesn't accumulate contextual debt,</b>

1272
03:07:04,799 --> 03:07:06,333
<b>which relates back to those prompts.</b>

1273
03:07:07,033 --> 03:07:08,366
<b>Is that kind of--</b>

1274
03:07:08,399 --> 03:07:09,433
<b>Yeah, something like that.</b>

1275
03:07:09,899 --> 03:07:11,000
<b>Something like that. So prompts, yeah.</b>

1276
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:12,933
<b>So prompts for the purple agent to build something,</b>

1277
03:07:13,866 --> 03:07:15,733
<b>and then we wait for the purple agent to build something,</b>

1278
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:19,233
<b>and then we evaluate what it builds against the prompts</b>

1279
03:07:19,533 --> 03:07:22,500
<b>and the why and the what behind those prompts, right?</b>

1280
03:07:24,233 --> 03:07:26,566
<b>Yeah, I think we need to think a bit more</b>

1281
03:07:26,566 --> 03:07:28,333
<b>about how to flesh out the benchmark.</b>

1282
03:07:29,200 --> 03:07:30,533
<b>I had people like kind of</b>

1283
03:07:30,533 --> 03:07:33,100
<b>discuss this another time as well,</b>

1284
03:07:33,100 --> 03:07:36,500
<b>but like just wanted to get some clarity on</b>

1285
03:07:37,033 --> 03:07:37,700
<b>where we're at.</b>

1286
03:07:38,399 --> 03:07:43,833
<b>But I sent some of the benchmark,</b>

1287
03:07:44,100 --> 03:07:45,333
<b>I think they are looking at</b>

1288
03:07:45,333 --> 03:07:49,299
<b>as the competition in the group.</b>

1289
03:07:50,033 --> 03:07:51,166
<b>It's in the Discord somewhere,</b>

1290
03:07:51,166 --> 03:07:52,433
<b>if you are, but I sent it in the chat.</b>

1291
03:07:53,833 --> 03:07:57,633
<b>And that's just some standard like benchmarks</b>

1292
03:07:57,899 --> 03:07:59,799
<b>that people use to evaluate like this.</b>

1293
03:08:00,433 --> 03:08:01,633
<b>Sweet, that's kind of different,</b>

1294
03:08:02,333 --> 03:08:03,600
<b>different types of agents for different tasks,</b>

1295
03:08:04,166 --> 03:08:07,000
<b>but what we are doing is slightly different,</b>

1296
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:08,799
<b>and I'm actually not super sure</b>

1297
03:08:08,799 --> 03:08:13,133
<b>how we're gonna frame the engine itself.</b>

1298
03:08:13,633 --> 03:08:15,266
<b>So I think some, from the benchmark itself,</b>

1299
03:08:15,933 --> 03:08:17,233
<b>I don't know if any of you have experienced</b>

1300
03:08:17,233 --> 03:08:18,899
<b>like building these kind of benchmarks</b>

1301
03:08:18,899 --> 03:08:21,933
<b>in a different field of trying,</b>

1302
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:26,200
<b>but the idea is that we wanna make a task</b>

1303
03:08:26,899 --> 03:08:30,033
<b>that we can evaluate like any agent on,</b>

1304
03:08:30,733 --> 03:08:31,299
<b>if that makes sense.</b>

1305
03:08:31,633 --> 03:08:34,100
<b>It's like a test, yeah.</b>

1306
03:08:34,600 --> 03:08:35,866
<b>It's a test that you can just run</b>

1307
03:08:36,466 --> 03:08:37,333
<b>without putting in a yes,</b>

1308
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:40,133
<b>but yeah, like just run different agents on</b>

1309
03:08:40,133 --> 03:08:41,233
<b>and then see if I can do it.</b>

1310
03:08:41,233 --> 03:08:44,333
<b>So we need like some kind of any real life,</b>

1311
03:08:44,733 --> 03:08:48,933
<b>we need some sort of rubric to figure out what always,</b>

1312
03:08:48,933 --> 03:08:50,700
<b>how we're measuring the content for that.</b>

1313
03:08:51,700 --> 03:08:53,500
<b>So yeah, the one,</b>

1314
03:08:55,100 --> 03:08:57,033
<b>yeah, just throwing some new thoughts.</b>

1315
03:08:57,033 --> 03:08:58,633
<b>So like, we think about it and like,</b>

1316
03:08:58,633 --> 03:09:00,799
<b>think if we put the discuss some,</b>

1317
03:09:01,700 --> 03:09:02,833
<b>how we really wanna put that,</b>

1318
03:09:03,066 --> 03:09:05,299
<b>because I'm still looking through the rubrics,</b>

1319
03:09:05,399 --> 03:09:06,966
<b>I think that's like one of the things</b>

1320
03:09:06,966 --> 03:09:08,700
<b>that they do that specifically for this,</b>

1321
03:09:09,366 --> 03:09:11,799
<b>which is like creating a benchmark,</b>

1322
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:13,299
<b>extend it and our benchmark,</b>

1323
03:09:14,666 --> 03:09:17,566
<b>the ideas that they want things to be that,</b>

1324
03:09:18,299 --> 03:09:19,533
<b>basically help the community to like,</b>

1325
03:09:20,100 --> 03:09:21,233
<b>evaluate agents in the formulas.</b>

1326
03:09:22,166 --> 03:09:25,466
<b>Yeah, so maybe like next time,</b>

1327
03:09:25,466 --> 03:09:26,700
<b>they'll have to try and evaluate</b>

1328
03:09:26,700 --> 03:09:28,533
<b>how good they are on our contextual</b>

1329
03:09:29,033 --> 03:09:30,600
<b>information score, like,</b>

1330
03:09:32,133 --> 03:09:34,033
<b>and specifically for security,</b>

1331
03:09:34,399 --> 03:09:36,233
<b>I think I have some questions on that,</b>

1332
03:09:36,233 --> 03:09:38,933
<b>like how we're gonna link like this content</b>

1333
03:09:38,933 --> 03:09:42,033
<b>for that here with like security wise,</b>

1334
03:09:42,033 --> 03:09:44,000
<b>because I think that's like in different concept as well.</b>

1335
03:09:45,500 --> 03:09:50,133
<b>But yeah, so I think that's about it,</b>

1336
03:09:50,133 --> 03:09:51,033
<b>just like some thoughts,</b>

1337
03:09:51,266 --> 03:09:52,600
<b>some questions I have on that,</b>

1338
03:09:52,866 --> 03:09:54,100
<b>but like direction wise,</b>

1339
03:09:54,100 --> 03:09:55,733
<b>it would be good specifically for this type of problem</b>

1340
03:09:55,733 --> 03:09:59,366
<b>to figure out what's, what everyone is, yeah.</b>

1341
03:10:00,366 --> 03:10:01,200
<b>Okay, okay.</b>

1342
03:10:02,433 --> 03:10:06,000
<b>Anybody else wanna add on to that first time or?</b>

1343
03:10:09,933 --> 03:10:11,899
<b>I don't think I know anything so much.</b>

1344
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,933
<b>Okay, okay, but I see what you're getting at,</b>

1345
03:10:17,933 --> 03:10:20,233
<b>and I agree, I think it's really important.</b>

1346
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:22,066
<b>I would appreciate it,</b>

1347
03:10:22,066 --> 03:10:25,500
<b>so once I get a group server up and running,</b>

1348
03:10:25,733 --> 03:10:29,133
<b>which will be like whenever this meeting wraps up,</b>

1349
03:10:29,133 --> 03:10:30,299
<b>I'll invite all you guys to it,</b>

1350
03:10:31,066 --> 03:10:34,200
<b>if you could rephrase that question</b>

1351
03:10:35,500 --> 03:10:37,600
<b>or basically goal for us</b>

1352
03:10:37,600 --> 03:10:39,766
<b>and just put it as a message into the chat,</b>

1353
03:10:39,766 --> 03:10:41,433
<b>that would be really helpful.</b>

1354
03:10:42,299 --> 03:10:43,700
<b>And then I'll provide the script,</b>

1355
03:10:43,700 --> 03:10:44,899
<b>the transcript too,</b>

1356
03:10:44,899 --> 03:10:46,833
<b>and kind of format that as an agenda.</b>

1357
03:10:47,466 --> 03:10:50,166
<b>Hopefully it will get picked up on that too, so.</b>

1358
03:10:51,799 --> 03:10:52,899
<b>But yeah, that's good,</b>

1359
03:10:52,899 --> 03:10:55,100
<b>we have to figure out whether or not</b>

1360
03:10:55,166 --> 03:10:59,033
<b>the plan currently addresses any aspect of that.</b>

1361
03:11:00,133 --> 03:11:03,366
<b>I feel like it hopefully touches on a little bit of that,</b>

1362
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:05,399
<b>but maybe not so much in the specifics.</b>

1363
03:11:07,033 --> 03:11:09,533
<b>Yeah, yeah.</b>

1364
03:11:11,033 --> 03:11:12,666
<b>And then I guess the last,</b>

1365
03:11:12,666 --> 03:11:15,299
<b>another admin is on like commitment wise,</b>

1366
03:11:15,966 --> 03:11:19,466
<b>I like, I'll be able to pick another paper here.</b>

1367
03:11:20,366 --> 03:11:21,933
<b>Yeah, how much?</b>

1368
03:11:23,266 --> 03:11:25,966
<b>Sorry, it's just, sure, sorry,</b>

1369
03:11:25,966 --> 03:11:26,933
<b>can you hear me now? Yeah.</b>

1370
03:11:28,433 --> 03:11:31,966
<b>Yeah, so I think it's like commitment wise.</b>

1371
03:11:32,799 --> 03:11:35,100
<b>And we can also discuss this like,</b>

1372
03:11:35,500 --> 03:11:36,533
<b>after we look through the,</b>

1373
03:11:37,533 --> 03:11:39,399
<b>like just how we commit and then,</b>

1374
03:11:39,799 --> 03:11:43,233
<b>and I guess if we're having between meetings,</b>

1375
03:11:43,533 --> 03:11:44,833
<b>like when's it gonna be,</b>

1376
03:11:44,833 --> 03:11:46,633
<b>and I also like stuff like that.</b>

1377
03:11:47,566 --> 03:11:47,733
<b>(laughing)</b>

1378
03:11:48,366 --> 03:11:49,600
<b>Just so we can have a view of that, yeah.</b>

1379
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:51,799
<b>So when you say the word commit,</b>

1380
03:11:51,799 --> 03:11:53,899
<b>are you talking about like committing to the repository</b>

1381
03:11:54,200 --> 03:11:55,399
<b>or your time commitment?</b>

1382
03:11:55,833 --> 03:11:56,033
<b>Which one?</b>

1383
03:11:57,333 --> 03:11:58,899
<b>I mean, for repositories, I don't know,</b>

1384
03:11:58,899 --> 03:12:01,733
<b>it's pretty standard, we just make a branch and stuff.</b>

1385
03:12:02,399 --> 03:12:05,299
<b>I think we should all kind of be a bit familiar with that,</b>

1386
03:12:05,666 --> 03:12:08,366
<b>but talking more of like working.</b>

1387
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:09,799
<b>Like team commitment.</b>

1388
03:12:10,500 --> 03:12:11,633
<b>How much time, yeah, exactly.</b>

1389
03:12:11,633 --> 03:12:13,000
<b>How much time can you put into this?</b>

1390
03:12:13,466 --> 03:12:15,066
<b>And what kind of what stuff</b>

1391
03:12:15,066 --> 03:12:16,299
<b>are you interested in working on?</b>

1392
03:12:16,866 --> 03:12:18,333
<b>And if the stuff you're interested in working on</b>

1393
03:12:18,333 --> 03:12:19,466
<b>is not given out,</b>

1394
03:12:19,466 --> 03:12:23,299
<b>like then like think about it.</b>

1395
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:24,100
<b>(mumbles)</b>

1396
03:12:27,333 --> 03:12:27,566
<b>That's good.</b>

1397
03:12:28,666 --> 03:12:29,833
<b>Yeah, if we can all outline</b>

1398
03:12:31,600 --> 03:12:34,566
<b>what our interests are in this repository,</b>

1399
03:12:35,399 --> 03:12:37,866
<b>in the group chat, they'll create later,</b>

1400
03:12:39,133 --> 03:12:40,899
<b>that will kind of help with the baseline commitment.</b>

1401
03:12:41,233 --> 03:12:45,100
<b>I think, I would say don't overexert yourself.</b>

1402
03:12:46,933 --> 03:12:49,899
<b>I think part of the commitment is going to be in,</b>

1403
03:12:52,066 --> 03:12:53,533
<b>sorry, I'm losing my train of thought again.</b>

1404
03:12:54,133 --> 03:12:56,033
<b>But yeah, I agree with everything that you said.</b>

1405
03:12:56,899 --> 03:12:59,266
<b>I think that we should definitely come up with</b>

1406
03:12:59,500 --> 03:13:02,166
<b>some kind of like team consensus document</b>

1407
03:13:02,333 --> 03:13:04,366
<b>of what aspects of the project</b>

1408
03:13:04,366 --> 03:13:06,633
<b>that we're personally committing ourselves to,</b>

1409
03:13:07,200 --> 03:13:10,700
<b>to ensure that there are no gaps in the repository</b>

1410
03:13:11,100 --> 03:13:14,733
<b>and that nothing is being kind of just looked past.</b>

1411
03:13:16,433 --> 03:13:20,066
<b>Hopefully that kind of just rephrased what you said, right?</b>

1412
03:13:20,500 --> 03:13:21,000
<b>Is that what you said?</b>

1413
03:13:21,333 --> 03:13:22,766
<b>Yeah, Facebook.</b>

1414
03:13:25,266 --> 03:13:26,100
<b>Yeah, I agree.</b>

1415
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:29,433
<b>And I feel like maybe like first,</b>

1416
03:13:29,666 --> 03:13:34,233
<b>I think we all go through the repository by ourself.</b>

1417
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:36,899
<b>And I think that because I mean,</b>

1418
03:13:37,233 --> 03:13:39,600
<b>when I checked the submission requirement,</b>

1419
03:13:40,100 --> 03:13:41,700
<b>I mean, or the judging criteria,</b>

1420
03:13:42,600 --> 03:13:44,333
<b>I think that the core is about</b>

1421
03:13:44,633 --> 03:13:45,933
<b>how do we define the benchmark</b>

1422
03:13:46,333 --> 03:13:48,000
<b>and benchmarking and all the stuff.</b>

1423
03:13:48,333 --> 03:13:50,899
<b>But other than that, there's still many minor stuff.</b>

1424
03:13:51,133 --> 03:13:52,933
<b>Like for example, you need to prepare</b>

1425
03:13:53,133 --> 03:13:55,200
<b>a clean repository, clear instruction,</b>

1426
03:13:56,033 --> 03:13:57,700
<b>or even a three minute video.</b>

1427
03:13:58,166 --> 03:14:00,566
<b>And I think all those minor things we also need to plan.</b>

1428
03:14:00,899 --> 03:14:03,899
<b>So I think maybe after everyone go through the repository</b>

1429
03:14:04,266 --> 03:14:05,366
<b>and if we meet next time,</b>

1430
03:14:05,366 --> 03:14:08,466
<b>or we just commute in the discord or in the chat,</b>

1431
03:14:08,866 --> 03:14:12,133
<b>then we can also write down maybe who to do what.</b>

1432
03:14:13,100 --> 03:14:16,433
<b>Because I feel like maybe we can have one person,</b>

1433
03:14:16,433 --> 03:14:19,933
<b>maybe Josh or Sam you, you can deep dive more</b>

1434
03:14:20,133 --> 03:14:23,000
<b>in the benchmarking part.</b>

1435
03:14:23,533 --> 03:14:27,100
<b>But I think for me, at least for the moment,</b>

1436
03:14:27,299 --> 03:14:29,200
<b>I feel like I would like to have</b>

1437
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:31,333
<b>a like grounding understanding of it.</b>

1438
03:14:31,799 --> 03:14:35,799
<b>But then maybe I can also focus on more the coding quality</b>

1439
03:14:36,033 --> 03:14:37,333
<b>or how can we make it better?</b>

1440
03:14:37,733 --> 03:14:40,066
<b>So I think we can also make like kind of</b>

1441
03:14:40,433 --> 03:14:41,766
<b>like specific for everyone</b>

1442
03:14:41,766 --> 03:14:45,100
<b>so that we can all contribute to the project as a team</b>

1443
03:14:45,433 --> 03:14:46,366
<b>then when we submit it.</b>

1444
03:14:46,733 --> 03:14:46,933
<b>So.</b>

1445
03:14:48,433 --> 03:14:49,033
<b>Okay, perfect.</b>

1446
03:14:50,200 --> 03:14:50,399
<b>Yeah.</b>

1447
03:14:51,399 --> 03:14:52,433
<b>Sorry, go ahead Finzi.</b>

1448
03:14:53,399 --> 03:14:55,066
<b>Yeah, I just wanted to add to that.</b>

1449
03:14:56,033 --> 03:14:57,700
<b>That's really, really necessary</b>

1450
03:14:58,033 --> 03:15:01,533
<b>because I think we have like four weeks or something</b>

1451
03:15:03,833 --> 03:15:06,633
<b>for the whole thing to be done.</b>

1452
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:09,133
<b>I thought I had a theoretical understanding</b>

1453
03:15:09,133 --> 03:15:11,100
<b>when I went through the repo,</b>

1454
03:15:11,366 --> 03:15:15,899
<b>but I need to run it on my, yeah.</b>

1455
03:15:16,899 --> 03:15:20,299
<b>Now I see that there was a lot that I didn't really look at</b>

1456
03:15:21,333 --> 03:15:23,566
<b>just like Garret says.</b>

1457
03:15:24,433 --> 03:15:28,233
<b>So it's important if we know</b>

1458
03:15:28,233 --> 03:15:30,566
<b>if we are going to be meeting every week and when,</b>

1459
03:15:30,766 --> 03:15:32,000
<b>maybe even from now.</b>

1460
03:15:32,399 --> 03:15:35,833
<b>But if we are not even able to talk about it now,</b>

1461
03:15:35,833 --> 03:15:38,100
<b>we should do that like as soon as</b>

1462
03:15:38,333 --> 03:15:42,299
<b>because of time constraint.</b>

1463
03:15:43,833 --> 03:15:44,033
<b>Yeah.</b>

1464
03:15:45,399 --> 03:15:45,700
<b>Sure.</b>

1465
03:15:47,500 --> 03:15:48,633
<b>Yeah, that's really good.</b>

1466
03:15:48,666 --> 03:15:50,600
<b>And I was hoping,</b>

1467
03:15:50,833 --> 03:15:53,033
<b>so when we do kind of pick out our roles</b>

1468
03:15:53,033 --> 03:15:55,566
<b>and make sure that like what you said,</b>

1469
03:15:56,200 --> 03:15:58,000
<b>even just making the presentation video</b>

1470
03:15:58,600 --> 03:16:00,333
<b>and the clean repository and the instructions,</b>

1471
03:16:01,733 --> 03:16:04,966
<b>there's kind of, there's a little bit of a table,</b>

1472
03:16:05,166 --> 03:16:08,866
<b>a role table for that in the project plan,</b>

1473
03:16:09,333 --> 03:16:11,166
<b>markdown document for that.</b>

1474
03:16:11,633 --> 03:16:13,766
<b>But I feel like we could totally tweak those roles</b>

1475
03:16:13,766 --> 03:16:14,666
<b>to make sure that,</b>

1476
03:16:15,500 --> 03:16:17,500
<b>you can just take inspiration from that table.</b>

1477
03:16:19,233 --> 03:16:21,333
<b>And yeah, when it comes to just like discovery</b>

1478
03:16:21,333 --> 03:16:24,500
<b>of the repository, yeah, please, please clone it.</b>

1479
03:16:24,700 --> 03:16:26,933
<b>And just to make sure that everything runs</b>

1480
03:16:27,066 --> 03:16:29,933
<b>without any module install errors and stuff.</b>

1481
03:16:31,066 --> 03:16:34,133
<b>From then on, you can do some little testing with that.</b>

1482
03:16:34,366 --> 03:16:36,500
<b>But I guess main priority is like,</b>

1483
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:37,833
<b>I know what runs on my machine.</b>

1484
03:16:38,066 --> 03:16:40,933
<b>I have a Windows 10 desktop,</b>

1485
03:16:40,933 --> 03:16:43,133
<b>you know, 64 bit or whatever.</b>

1486
03:16:44,500 --> 03:16:47,633
<b>But yeah, try and just make sure it runs on your stuff too.</b>

1487
03:16:48,466 --> 03:16:49,799
<b>If you guys run into any issues,</b>

1488
03:16:50,100 --> 03:16:52,333
<b>just please, please document them.</b>

1489
03:16:53,233 --> 03:16:54,333
<b>Yeah, I really agree.</b>

1490
03:16:54,333 --> 03:16:55,666
<b>That's really good that you're following the rules.</b>

1491
03:16:56,600 --> 03:16:57,899
<b>Are you guys good?</b>

1492
03:16:58,166 --> 03:16:59,399
<b>So I know that you guys are in</b>

1493
03:16:59,399 --> 03:17:00,733
<b>kind of in different time zones.</b>

1494
03:17:01,166 --> 03:17:03,533
<b>Like Garrett, you're here at 3 a.m.</b>

1495
03:17:04,799 --> 03:17:10,000
<b>So depending on what you're gonna be doing later today,</b>

1496
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:11,633
<b>I don't know if you're gonna go back to sleep,</b>

1497
03:17:11,633 --> 03:17:13,533
<b>take a nap or it's like, it's okay.</b>

1498
03:17:14,200 --> 03:17:18,299
<b>So it's 7.30 my time.</b>

1499
03:17:18,333 --> 03:17:19,566
<b>What time is it for you?</b>

1500
03:17:21,100 --> 03:17:22,233
<b>Now it's 4.30.</b>

1501
03:17:23,500 --> 03:17:25,133
<b>Dude, thank you.</b>

1502
03:17:25,133 --> 03:17:27,200
<b>I think we should let the man get to sleep.</b>

1503
03:17:27,466 --> 03:17:27,966
<b>Yeah, dude.</b>

1504
03:17:28,866 --> 03:17:33,133
<b>So I was thinking like, okay, every Friday we can do,</b>

1505
03:17:33,899 --> 03:17:37,899
<b>I think it would be good for us to potentially pair up</b>

1506
03:17:38,100 --> 03:17:39,633
<b>depending on time zones.</b>

1507
03:17:40,033 --> 03:17:40,899
<b>So if you guys are like,</b>

1508
03:17:41,233 --> 03:17:43,466
<b>if it's really late in the night for some of you guys,</b>

1509
03:17:43,466 --> 03:17:47,433
<b>maybe a little bit earlier on this Friday.</b>

1510
03:17:48,899 --> 03:17:51,166
<b>For you, Garrett, I was hoping potentially</b>

1511
03:17:51,166 --> 03:17:53,966
<b>maybe you could meet with me in a few hours.</b>

1512
03:17:53,966 --> 03:17:56,633
<b>This would be one in the morning my time.</b>

1513
03:17:56,633 --> 03:18:00,666
<b>So 7.30, 8.30, 9.30, 10.30, 11, 12.</b>

1514
03:18:01,633 --> 03:18:04,066
<b>And then so in five and a half hours,</b>

1515
03:18:04,066 --> 03:18:05,899
<b>would you be free in five and a half hours</b>

1516
03:18:05,899 --> 03:18:07,100
<b>because I have a teammate</b>

1517
03:18:07,100 --> 03:18:11,133
<b>who's in Germany as well, I think.</b>

1518
03:18:12,600 --> 03:18:14,000
<b>It would be around.</b>

1519
03:18:14,299 --> 03:18:14,633
<b>Okay, so.</b>

1520
03:18:15,433 --> 03:18:18,266
<b>I think that would be around 10 in the morning for you.</b>

1521
03:18:19,666 --> 03:18:21,633
<b>So how many hours after?</b>

1522
03:18:22,866 --> 03:18:25,133
<b>So five and a half hours from now,</b>

1523
03:18:25,500 --> 03:18:28,200
<b>I'm going to be meeting with somebody else</b>

1524
03:18:28,200 --> 03:18:29,899
<b>who I think lives in Germany too.</b>

1525
03:18:31,500 --> 03:18:36,433
<b>Okay, I think that would be about 10 or 11, right?</b>

1526
03:18:37,566 --> 03:18:42,500
<b>So yeah, I need to check if I could still wake up,</b>

1527
03:18:43,566 --> 03:18:43,899
<b>to be honest.</b>

1528
03:18:44,433 --> 03:18:46,000
<b>It's okay, no worries, no worries.</b>

1529
03:18:46,500 --> 03:18:48,333
<b>But I'm saying like next week.</b>

1530
03:18:49,299 --> 03:18:50,266
<b>Ah yeah, I mean.</b>

1531
03:18:50,533 --> 03:18:51,366
<b>Next week, do that instead.</b>

1532
03:18:52,166 --> 03:18:55,033
<b>And then, because that would help for eight,</b>

1533
03:18:55,866 --> 03:18:56,799
<b>I'm a night owl, right?</b>

1534
03:18:57,133 --> 03:19:00,466
<b>I like to stay up until 10 or 11 AM your time.</b>

1535
03:19:00,466 --> 03:19:02,066
<b>So I can always just meet with you then.</b>

1536
03:19:03,500 --> 03:19:06,566
<b>And then just record other,</b>

1537
03:19:06,566 --> 03:19:09,233
<b>I think if we meet asynchronously,</b>

1538
03:19:09,233 --> 03:19:10,933
<b>I think everybody should record their meetings.</b>

1539
03:19:11,633 --> 03:19:13,833
<b>And then I can help with transcript organization</b>

1540
03:19:13,833 --> 03:19:14,633
<b>and all that.</b>

1541
03:19:14,933 --> 03:19:16,500
<b>We can all be on the same page that way.</b>

1542
03:19:16,500 --> 03:19:19,200
<b>We don't have to meet everybody at once.</b>

1543
03:19:19,966 --> 03:19:24,333
<b>But yeah, are Fridays slash Saturday mornings</b>

1544
03:19:24,333 --> 03:19:27,033
<b>a good day for you guys to do?</b>

1545
03:19:28,766 --> 03:19:30,666
<b>For me, this time works,</b>

1546
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,200
<b>but even later in the night works.</b>

1547
03:19:33,466 --> 03:19:37,433
<b>But during the day, during the weekdays,</b>

1548
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:39,266
<b>I don't have time.</b>

1549
03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:42,866
<b>But I'm also a night person like you are.</b>

1550
03:19:44,133 --> 03:19:47,566
<b>Yeah, so most of the nights I'm able to do extra,</b>

1551
03:19:48,100 --> 03:19:52,600
<b>other works other than my PhD work here.</b>

1552
03:19:52,899 --> 03:19:53,100
<b>So.</b>

1553
03:19:54,233 --> 03:19:54,833
<b>Okay, sweet.</b>

1554
03:19:55,766 --> 03:19:58,600
<b>Yeah, and don't burn yourselves out.</b>

1555
03:19:59,033 --> 03:20:01,833
<b>You can commit to as much as you feel comfortable doing.</b>

1556
03:20:02,600 --> 03:20:04,299
<b>The gaps will get filled some ways.</b>

1557
03:20:04,633 --> 03:20:06,100
<b>It's gonna be, it'll work out.</b>

1558
03:20:08,200 --> 03:20:09,799
<b>Yeah, I agree with scheduling.</b>

1559
03:20:10,799 --> 03:20:12,100
<b>So we can try and figure out</b>

1560
03:20:13,633 --> 03:20:15,200
<b>how people can kind of pair up.</b>

1561
03:20:15,500 --> 03:20:17,399
<b>And then we can just do asynchronous meetings</b>

1562
03:20:19,100 --> 03:20:21,200
<b>and then just consolidate the updates</b>

1563
03:20:21,333 --> 03:20:23,700
<b>into some kind of channel,</b>

1564
03:20:24,100 --> 03:20:27,766
<b>some kind of log folder just for team updates.</b>

1565
03:20:29,833 --> 03:20:30,700
<b>Yeah, that makes sense, right?</b>

1566
03:20:32,399 --> 03:20:35,500
<b>Yeah, I think asynchronous meeting</b>

1567
03:20:35,666 --> 03:20:37,833
<b>and also add like, I think more importantly,</b>

1568
03:20:37,833 --> 03:20:39,133
<b>we have kind of team channel.</b>

1569
03:20:39,833 --> 03:20:41,833
<b>I think GitHub is actually also good</b>

1570
03:20:41,833 --> 03:20:44,066
<b>that we can make use of it.</b>

1571
03:20:44,333 --> 03:20:45,600
<b>But like, for example,</b>

1572
03:20:45,933 --> 03:20:48,066
<b>I think there's some Microsoft planners</b>

1573
03:20:48,333 --> 03:20:50,500
<b>we can also use to plan up the task</b>

1574
03:20:51,066 --> 03:20:52,833
<b>and with the deadline or kind of stuff.</b>

1575
03:20:54,500 --> 03:20:58,899
<b>Yeah, then we can kind of also send with chat and yeah.</b>

1576
03:20:59,100 --> 03:21:03,966
<b>So not really need to do it like every time</b>

1577
03:21:03,966 --> 03:21:07,899
<b>it face to like on a call,</b>

1578
03:21:08,566 --> 03:21:09,766
<b>but maybe once a week,</b>

1579
03:21:10,266 --> 03:21:14,533
<b>but then we will like frequently talk in a team chat.</b>

1580
03:21:15,233 --> 03:21:16,766
<b>So yeah, that would be great.</b>

1581
03:21:18,433 --> 03:21:19,200
<b>Okay, perfect.</b>

1582
03:21:21,299 --> 03:21:22,833
<b>Okay, let's see.</b>

1583
03:21:23,899 --> 03:21:25,533
<b>Wow, we've met for an hour and a half now.</b>

1584
03:21:26,100 --> 03:21:28,433
<b>So I'm gonna invite all of you guys</b>

1585
03:21:28,633 --> 03:21:32,733
<b>to this server that I just created.</b>

1586
03:21:33,066 --> 03:21:34,933
<b>Well, I created the server for months ago</b>

1587
03:21:34,933 --> 03:21:36,033
<b>but there's nobody in it.</b>

1588
03:21:36,333 --> 03:21:39,100
<b>And I'm just making sure,</b>

1589
03:21:39,633 --> 03:21:41,600
<b>see if I can find everybody here.</b>

1590
03:21:44,200 --> 03:21:46,733
<b>Okay, let's see.</b>

1591
03:21:47,933 --> 03:21:52,833
<b>I'm having trouble seeing all of the usernames here.</b>

1592
03:21:56,299 --> 03:21:58,633
<b>Encarceron, is that you Samuel?</b>

1593
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:00,433
<b>Yeah, that's me.</b>

1594
03:22:00,600 --> 03:22:01,299
<b>Okay, sweet.</b>

1595
03:22:01,299 --> 03:22:02,633
<b>I just sent you an invite.</b>

1596
03:22:03,833 --> 03:22:03,899
<b>Yeah.</b>

1597
03:22:06,299 --> 03:22:07,566
<b>Oh, come on.</b>

1598
03:22:11,200 --> 03:22:13,433
<b>Sorry Hadiza, do you know your Discord username?</b>

1599
03:22:14,666 --> 03:22:16,166
<b>Yeah, I think you should be hadix.</b>

1600
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:20,233
<b>I found it.</b>

1601
03:22:20,266 --> 03:22:20,566
<b>Hadiza.</b>

1602
03:22:21,200 --> 03:22:21,733
<b>There we go.</b>

1603
03:22:22,299 --> 03:22:23,299
<b>Same thing, yeah.</b>

1604
03:22:23,399 --> 03:22:26,133
<b>Okay, so I think I just sent everybody an invite.</b>

1605
03:22:26,833 --> 03:22:30,433
<b>If you haven't received an invite, please let me know now.</b>

1606
03:22:32,200 --> 03:22:33,833
<b>Deep T, I think I sent you a name.</b>

1607
03:22:34,299 --> 03:22:35,000
<b>All right.</b>

1608
03:22:37,899 --> 03:22:39,433
<b>So, and then I'll give you all of you guys</b>

1609
03:22:39,533 --> 03:22:40,433
<b>moderator access.</b>

1610
03:22:40,666 --> 03:22:44,633
<b>So if you want to create channels, change channel names</b>

1611
03:22:44,633 --> 03:22:47,299
<b>or do whatever you want with the server, that's fine.</b>

1612
03:22:49,933 --> 03:22:51,233
<b>That'll be a good balancing point</b>

1613
03:22:51,700 --> 03:22:55,633
<b>for how we can better organize the GitHub repository</b>

1614
03:22:56,000 --> 03:22:58,766
<b>to accommodate our needs and preferences.</b>

1615
03:23:01,200 --> 03:23:02,299
<b>Like I said, logs are a mess.</b>

1616
03:23:02,733 --> 03:23:04,866
<b>So we'll work with what we got now,</b>

1617
03:23:05,033 --> 03:23:09,633
<b>but what's come to a consensus on how we will</b>

1618
03:23:10,833 --> 03:23:13,899
<b>organize our logs and documentation in the repository</b>

1619
03:23:14,899 --> 03:23:15,600
<b>through the server.</b>

1620
03:23:16,433 --> 03:23:20,200
<b>And then we can figure it out from there.</b>

1621
03:23:20,766 --> 03:23:22,066
<b>Is it, am I missing anything?</b>

1622
03:23:25,600 --> 03:23:26,133
<b>Does that make sense?</b>

1623
03:23:29,299 --> 03:23:30,366
<b>Yeah, it does.</b>

1624
03:23:32,799 --> 03:23:35,200
<b>I know the task right now is still in chunks.</b>

1625
03:23:37,266 --> 03:23:39,833
<b>I don't know if before or by the next time we meet,</b>

1626
03:23:39,833 --> 03:23:41,799
<b>we're able to break them down.</b>

1627
03:23:42,066 --> 03:23:44,866
<b>Maybe we all have gone through the repository</b>

1628
03:23:45,100 --> 03:23:47,133
<b>and have understood everything in there.</b>

1629
03:23:47,533 --> 03:23:49,899
<b>Yeah, because what we call in the end</b>

1630
03:23:49,899 --> 03:23:51,466
<b>is very high level.</b>

1631
03:23:52,766 --> 03:23:57,166
<b>Yes, if we could break it together into smaller chunks,</b>

1632
03:23:57,433 --> 03:23:59,200
<b>that would be less.</b>

1633
03:24:01,333 --> 03:24:02,133
<b>I don't know how to put it.</b>

1634
03:24:02,133 --> 03:24:05,600
<b>It would be less the way it works on the brain.</b>

1635
03:24:06,600 --> 03:24:08,133
<b>I don't know the English word, but.</b>

1636
03:24:08,633 --> 03:24:09,033
<b>It's okay.</b>

1637
03:24:09,633 --> 03:24:12,399
<b>So when it is small, small, small, small like this,</b>

1638
03:24:12,899 --> 03:24:13,700
<b>it's yeah.</b>

1639
03:24:15,200 --> 03:24:15,433
<b>It's-</b>

1640
03:24:15,733 --> 03:24:17,633
<b>We were able to achieve that before</b>

1641
03:24:17,799 --> 03:24:19,066
<b>or by the next time we meet.</b>

1642
03:24:19,899 --> 03:24:20,533
<b>Yeah, for sure.</b>

1643
03:24:21,233 --> 03:24:24,633
<b>And I was thinking maybe we could make</b>

1644
03:24:24,633 --> 03:24:27,200
<b>like one channel for each thing.</b>

1645
03:24:28,533 --> 03:24:30,933
<b>It's okay if we have a ton of channels.</b>

1646
03:24:32,600 --> 03:24:33,433
<b>We can do channel.</b>

1647
03:24:33,766 --> 03:24:35,333
<b>I don't know if you guys use Discord a lot,</b>

1648
03:24:35,333 --> 03:24:36,200
<b>but there's this thing where</b>

1649
03:24:36,200 --> 03:24:38,133
<b>you can group channels together.</b>

1650
03:24:40,333 --> 03:24:41,899
<b>So, we could have a,</b>

1651
03:24:43,133 --> 03:24:45,100
<b>just a document organization section</b>

1652
03:24:45,100 --> 03:24:47,433
<b>and then a channel for each, whatever.</b>

1653
03:24:48,366 --> 03:24:51,100
<b>Or a, and then we can have a planning section</b>

1654
03:24:51,100 --> 03:24:52,766
<b>and then a channel just for planning</b>

1655
03:24:52,766 --> 03:24:54,833
<b>the contextual integrity score</b>

1656
03:24:55,433 --> 03:24:57,666
<b>and the math logic behind that</b>

1657
03:24:57,666 --> 03:25:00,600
<b>and how we're comparing that to the code base</b>

1658
03:25:00,600 --> 03:25:02,333
<b>and just a couple of examples there.</b>

1659
03:25:03,633 --> 03:25:05,399
<b>But yeah, we have a really good starting off point.</b>

1660
03:25:06,266 --> 03:25:10,333
<b>And yeah, I think it'll take us kind of a week</b>

1661
03:25:10,333 --> 03:25:14,200
<b>to come to a general consensus on how to move forward.</b>

1662
03:25:14,799 --> 03:25:19,433
<b>So I'm not expecting any code to be updated</b>

1663
03:25:19,899 --> 03:25:22,933
<b>unless you guys find bugs in the code.</b>

1664
03:25:23,566 --> 03:25:25,600
<b>So right now it's kind of just discovery,</b>

1665
03:25:26,133 --> 03:25:28,299
<b>making sure we're all on the same page with the code</b>

1666
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:33,733
<b>and figuring out how to organize the documents</b>

1667
03:25:33,966 --> 03:25:37,766
<b>and the current logs to better sync our understanding.</b>

1668
03:25:38,266 --> 03:25:41,933
<b>And then we can move forward with refactoring the plan</b>

1669
03:25:42,100 --> 03:25:45,000
<b>and getting all that benchmark logic out there.</b>

1670
03:25:46,833 --> 03:25:51,066
<b>So, oh, before, I feel like this is a good time</b>

1671
03:25:51,166 --> 03:25:53,100
<b>for us to start to wrap up.</b>

1672
03:25:53,700 --> 03:25:55,633
<b>Before I let you guys go, I wanna see if,</b>

1673
03:25:57,433 --> 03:26:00,966
<b>because I know that somebody had some questions</b>

1674
03:26:00,966 --> 03:26:02,600
<b>that they wanted to ask us.</b>

1675
03:26:04,100 --> 03:26:04,633
<b>Here we go.</b>

1676
03:26:06,566 --> 03:26:07,066
<b>Here we go.</b>

1677
03:26:07,066 --> 03:26:09,600
<b>It was, yeah, it was Allah.</b>

1678
03:26:09,833 --> 03:26:11,899
<b>So he also lives in Germany.</b>

1679
03:26:12,133 --> 03:26:14,266
<b>Maybe next week you can meet him, Garrett,</b>

1680
03:26:15,100 --> 03:26:16,833
<b>but he'll see the recording from this meeting.</b>

1681
03:26:18,299 --> 03:26:20,233
<b>Yeah, so he had some questions over.</b>

1682
03:26:21,166 --> 03:26:22,700
<b>He had some pretty specific questions.</b>

1683
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:27,033
<b>If we've discussed the choice of LLMs for the evaluator</b>

1684
03:26:27,033 --> 03:26:29,500
<b>and the evaluated agents, you know what?</b>

1685
03:26:29,500 --> 03:26:32,733
<b>I'm just going to, I'll invite him to the Discord server</b>

1686
03:26:32,733 --> 03:26:35,899
<b>and then I'll paste his questions in the chat.</b>

1687
03:26:36,933 --> 03:26:39,700
<b>Because I feel like if I read them now,</b>

1688
03:26:39,700 --> 03:26:42,000
<b>we would just kind of go into discussion</b>

1689
03:26:42,233 --> 03:26:44,133
<b>and I don't wanna do that right now, tired.</b>

1690
03:26:46,566 --> 03:26:49,266
<b>But yeah, guys, thanks for coming to this meeting.</b>

1691
03:26:51,200 --> 03:26:52,833
<b>This was a lot.</b>

1692
03:26:53,566 --> 03:26:58,366
<b>So I will save this recording</b>

1693
03:26:58,799 --> 03:27:02,200
<b>and I'll have a transcript summary of the meeting</b>

1694
03:27:03,033 --> 03:27:04,566
<b>in about an hour from now.</b>

1695
03:27:05,333 --> 03:27:06,500
<b>And I'll just put it in the Discord.</b>

1696
03:27:07,200 --> 03:27:12,799
<b>I'll put, I'll invite Allah to the Discord too.</b>

1697
03:27:13,833 --> 03:27:16,133
<b>And I think we should be good to go for that.</b>

1698
03:27:16,133 --> 03:27:18,733
<b>There were a couple people that were interested in coming</b>

1699
03:27:19,733 --> 03:27:20,933
<b>and they didn't make it.</b>

1700
03:27:22,666 --> 03:27:24,799
<b>I don't know if it's because they didn't understand</b>

1701
03:27:24,799 --> 03:27:26,700
<b>that it was gonna be in this time zone or not.</b>

1702
03:27:27,399 --> 03:27:29,100
<b>Cause I heard from them earlier today,</b>

1703
03:27:29,100 --> 03:27:30,966
<b>but I think there were two people</b>

1704
03:27:30,966 --> 03:27:32,200
<b>that couldn't make this meeting.</b>

1705
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:36,766
<b>So I'll try and get them up to date too</b>

1706
03:27:37,200 --> 03:27:38,799
<b>and assume that they're still interested.</b>

1707
03:27:39,033 --> 03:27:43,866
<b>Other than that, I think we have a good solid team of five.</b>

1708
03:27:44,166 --> 03:27:45,833
<b>So this has been really exciting.</b>

1709
03:27:46,333 --> 03:27:47,633
<b>And hey, I just wanted to say thank you</b>

1710
03:27:47,633 --> 03:27:49,233
<b>for bearing with me on this, okay?</b>

<b>Because like, I'm really ambitious,</b>

1712
03:27:54,433 --> 03:27:58,200
<b>but it takes, I'm sure you guys have noticed,</b>

1713
03:27:58,433 --> 03:27:59,700
<b>like you guys asked me something</b>

1714
03:28:00,233 --> 03:28:01,733
<b>and it takes me a couple of times</b>

1715
03:28:01,733 --> 03:28:03,233
<b>to really understand what you're saying.</b>

1716
03:28:04,633 --> 03:28:05,833
