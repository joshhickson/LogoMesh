## Task: Define all data structures in the `contracts` package with 100% strict TypeScript compliance.

Today, I have created the foundational data contracts for the LogoMesh C-IDE. These contracts are fully compliant with our strict TypeScript rules, with a zero-tolerance policy for the `any` type.

### Progress:

- **Created Core Entity Definitions**: The core data structures of our application, such as `Thought`, `Segment`, `Tag`, and `Evaluation`, have been defined in `packages/contracts/src/entities.ts`.
- **Created Package Entry Point**: An `index.ts` file has been created to export these new types, making them accessible to other packages in the monorepo.
- **Created `tsconfig.json` files**: A package-specific `tsconfig.json` has been created in `packages/contracts/`, and a shared `tsconfig.base.json` has been created in the root directory to ensure that the package is built correctly and adheres to our strict standards.
- **Updated `build` script**: The `build` script in `packages/contracts/package.json` has been updated to use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).

The core data contracts are now in place, providing a solid, type-safe foundation for the rest of the application.
