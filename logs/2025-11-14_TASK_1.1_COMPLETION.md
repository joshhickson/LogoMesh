# Log for 2025-11-14: Task 1.1 Completion

## Task
Completed Task 1.1 from `logs/2025-11-13_RECOVERY_PLAN.md`: Integrate Static Analysis into `architecturalDebtAnalyzer`.

## Summary of Work
1.  **Implemented `ArchitecturalDebtAnalyzer`**: Replaced the mock implementation with a functional one using the `escomplex` library.
2.  **Defined Data Contract**: Created a new `ArchitecturalDebtReport` interface in `@logomesh/contracts` to provide a detailed and structured output.
3.  **Added Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling to catch and report syntax errors in the analyzed code, returning a score of `0.0` and a descriptive error message.
4.  **Wrote Unit Tests**: Created a new test suite for the analyzer, with test cases for simple code, complex code, and code with syntax errors.
5.  **Resolved Environment Issues**: Navigated and resolved several build and dependency issues related to `isolated-vm`, `vitest`, and Node.js version incompatibilities.

## Outcome
The `architecturalDebtAnalyzer` is now a production-ready component that provides meaningful, data-driven scores for code quality, fulfilling the acceptance criteria for Task 1.1.
