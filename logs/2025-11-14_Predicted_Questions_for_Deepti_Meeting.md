# Predicted Questions for Deepti Meeting (2025-11-14)

## Executive Summary

This document contains a prioritized list of predicted questions from your collaborator, Deepti, for your upcoming meeting. These questions were generated by cross-referencing her "Dual-Pillar" persona (Data Scientist + TPM) with a deep analysis of the repository's current state, focusing on the gap between the ambitious `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and the "Week 2 prototype" reality of the code.

The questions are designed to be specific, evidence-based, and challenging, reflecting her likely areas of focus.

## 1. Data Science & Metrics Questions
*(This is Deepti wearing her Pillar 2 "Applied Data Scientist" hat. She will focus on the validity, reproducibility, and underlying data of your core "Contextual Debt" metric.)*

1.  **The "Ground Truth" Question:** "Your `EvaluationOrchestrator` code currently uses a hardcoded reasoning trace with the placeholder `'irrelevant context'`. How are you planning to source and validate the ground-truth data needed to train or test the `rationaleDebtAnalyzer`? Without a real, labeled dataset, how can we trust the metric?"

2.  **The "Metric Definition" Question:** "The `PROJECT_PLAN` defines 'Contextual Debt' as a key innovation. As a Data Scientist, I need to understand how this is measured. Can you walk me through the specific, quantifiable features that go into the final `contextualDebtScore`? How do you prevent it from being a subjective or non-reproducible metric?"

3.  **The "NLP Model" Question:** "My experience at Meta was in using Transformer models like BERT for classification. Your `rationaleDebtAnalyzer` seems to be doing something more nuanced. Are you using a fine-tuned LLM for this analysis? If so, what is the underlying model, and what does the fine-tuning or prompt engineering process look like?"

4.  **The "Data Pipeline" Question:** "I see the orchestrator fetches a `taskThought` from a `StorageAdapter`. Can you describe the end-to-end data pipeline? Where does the 'Purple Agent's' code and rationale actually come from, and how is it reliably fed into the analysis workers to ensure a fair evaluation?"

## 2. Technical & Architectural Questions
*(This is Deepti blending her senior engineering background with modern data practices. She will probe the robustness and completeness of your implementation.)*

5.  **The "Sandbox" Question:** "Your `RECOVERY_PLAN` and `PROJECT_PLAN` both highlight a secure sandbox using `isolated-vm` for the `testingDebtAnalyzer`. However, `isolated-vm` is not listed as a dependency in the `workers` package. What is the true implementation status of the secure sandbox, and what are the security implications of running untrusted test code without it?"

6.  **The "Persistence" Question:** "I noticed the `EvaluationOrchestrator` stores all evaluation state in an in-memory `Map`. While I see `sqlite` in the `core` package's dependencies, the main orchestration logic doesn't seem to use it. What is your strategy for persistence, and how do you handle service restarts or ensure results aren't lost?"

7.  **The "Static Analysis" Question:** "You've included `escomplex` as a dependency for the `architecturalDebtAnalyzer`. Can you show me exactly where this is used in the worker and how its raw output is translated into the final `architecturalCoherenceDebt` score? I want to understand how you moved from a prototype to a data-driven implementation."

8.  **The "Asynchronous API" Question:** "The orchestrator correctly kicks off the evaluation as a background job and returns a `202 Accepted`. This is a good asynchronous pattern. However, what is the client's expected behavior for polling, and what happens if a worker job fails? How is that error state communicated back to the user via the `GET /v1/evaluate/{evaluationId}` endpoint?"

## 3. TPM & Risk Questions
*(This is Deepti wearing her Pillar 1 "Process-Driven Architect & Program Manager" hat. She will focus on project risk, planning, and the path to completion.)*

9.  **The "Plan vs. Reality" Question:** "Your `PROJECT_PLAN` outlines an ambitious 6-week timeline with major deliverables like a full Auth0 integration and a sandboxed test environment. Given the 'Week 2' status of the code, what is your risk mitigation strategy if these critical-path items take longer than the one or two weeks allocated?"

10. **The "Un-scoped Dependency" Question:** "I see you're using BullMQ and Redis for the orchestration, which is great. I also see `sqlite` in your dependencies, but it's not mentioned in the architecture diagrams or high-level plans. What is its intended role, and should we add it to the formal project plan to account for its maintenance?"

11. **The "Definition of Done" Question:** "As a TPM, 'Done' is a key concept. What are the specific, measurable exit criteria for this project to be considered a 'winning submission'? For example, how many cybersecurity benchmark tasks must be fully implemented and passing end-to-end for you to consider the project complete?"

12. **The "Auth0 Implementation" Question:** "It's great to see the Auth0 dependencies in `package.json`. Can you walk me through the current user-facing implementation? For example, how does a 'Purple Agent' acquire the JWT needed to interact with a secure tool, and how is that process audited?"
