    I want to revise the Phase 2 draft to make it explicitly clear that every system is being prepared but not fully connected or activated in Phase 2. Phase 2 is about building the infrastructure, abstractions, and testable interfaces for each major system (VTC, MeshGraph, DevShell, LLMExecutor, TTS, etc). Phase 3 will handle external integration, agent-level behaviors, real-time LLM orchestration, and multi-model workflows. Update the draft by doing the following for each major theme:

Revision Rules for Each Section:

    ‚úÖ Reframe Objectives

        Clarify that this phase is building the foundation, not activating full autonomy.

        Phrase goals like ‚Äúscaffold the interface for...‚Äù or ‚Äúbuild local-first stubs for...‚Äù

    ‚úÖ Add a ‚ÄúPhase 3 Activation‚Äù Subsection

        At the end of each major theme (VTC, Graph, TaskEngine, etc.), add a short subsection:

        ### Phase 3 Activation Plan
        - Replace mock/stub executor with real-time LLM orchestrator
        - Enable agent feedback loops and dynamic pipeline generation
        - Connect to cloud or multi-user collaboration interfaces

    ‚úÖ Explicitly Mark Placeholder Implementations

        Use TODO or üöß Stub comments in sample code or schema (e.g. // TODO: Replace with real LLM selector)

        Clarify which elements are mock/test-only and which are permanent architecture

    ‚úÖ Defer Cognitive Features Intelligently

        Push features like auto-summarization, intent interpretation, agent voting, and cross-context synthesis to Phase 3

        Instead, prepare the logging, scoring, and interfaces that would power those features

    ‚úÖ Add a Final Summary Section
    Title it: Phase 2 Boundary: Preparation for Autonomy
    Summarize:

        What has been deliberately left unintegrated

        What success looks like for Phase 2 (robustness, predictability, zero-dependency local ops)

        The minimum quality bar required for Phase 3 ignition (e.g. zero audit gaps, pipeline determinism, executor availability)

üõ†Ô∏è EXAMPLE APPLICATION (for Claude to mirror)

Current:

    "TaskEngine will route tasks to any registered executor and dynamically orchestrate pipelines."

Updated:

    "TaskEngine will scaffold deterministic routing to mock or test executors, simulating cognitive pipeline behavior. In Phase 3, these will be replaced with real-time task orchestration via external LLMs and DevShell-generated pipelines."

Final Suggestion

Tell Claude:

    ‚ÄúApply this logic systemically across all major systems in Phase 2, and generate a short summary table at the end mapping each system to its Phase 3 activation goals.‚Äù
