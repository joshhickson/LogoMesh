6. Content Revisions & New Files (To be done by Claude after moves):

File to Revise: docs/phase_2/01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN/ROADMAPS_AND_SCHEDULES/phase_2_PLANNING_COMPLETION_LOG.md

Action: Drastically rephrase to remove ambiguity about code implementation.
Ensure the title clearly reflects it's a planning log.
Rewrite introductory text to state it tracks planning and specification task completion.
Change all "‚úÖ COMPLETED" markers to "‚úÖ SPECIFICATION COMPLETED" or "‚úÖ PLANNING TASK COMPLETED".
Remove or rephrase triumphal language like "üèÜ PHASE 2 COMPLETION ACHIEVED." Replace with "Phase 2 Specification Phase Concluded."
Ensure the initial disclaimer about it being a log of planning is very prominent.
File to Create: A new main docs/phase_2/README.md (at the root of docs/phase_2/)

Content: This README should explain the new top-level directory structure:
00_CURRENT_STATE/: Purpose (e.g., "Documents reflecting the actual implemented state of the project after Phase 1 and any subsequent minor updates. Phase 2 features will only appear here post-implementation.")
01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN/: Purpose (e.g., "All documents related to the planning, specification, analysis, and roadmapping of Phase 2 features. THIS IS THE PRIMARY FOLDER FOR UNDERSTANDING PHASE 2 PLANS.")
02_EXPLORATIONS_AND_IDEAS/: Purpose (e.g., "Hypothetical scenarios, brainstorming, and suggestions not yet part of the formal Phase 2 plan.")
ZZ_ARCHIVE/: Purpose (e.g., "Outdated or superseded planning documents for historical reference.")
It should guide users to 01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN/README.md for more details on the planning documents.
File to Update: docs/phase_2/01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN/README.md (which was the original docs/phase_2/README.md)

Action: Update its content to explain the new structure within 01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN:
SPECIFICATIONS/: Purpose (e.g., "Core design blueprints, detailed component specifications, and architectural diagrams for planned Phase 2 features. Key document: phase2_core_specifications.md.")
ANALYSIS_AND_REPORTS/: Purpose (e.g., "Supporting analyses, gap reviews, planning progress reports, and strategic recommendations related to Phase 2 planning.")
ROADMAPS_AND_SCHEDULES/: Purpose (e.g., "Timelines, critical path analyses, implementation priorities, and logs tracking the completion of planning and specification tasks.")
Important Considerations for Claude:

For steps 4 and 5, Claude should dynamically list files in docs/phase_2/ to ensure all relevant Addendum and 'day_X' files are processed.
Care should be taken with filenames containing spaces or special characters, using quotes or escapes as needed for the mv command.
The content revisions for phase2_core_specifications.md and phase2_architecture_diagram.md that I (Jules) performed earlier will persist in their new locations. The main content revision for Claude will be for phase_2_PLANNING_COMPLETION_LOG.md and the READMEs.
