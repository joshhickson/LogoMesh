### Story #5 — “Verse Velocity: Keeping Up With a Citation-Heavy Sermon”

**Setup**

Mac mini M4 (16 GB unified RAM) drives three sanctuary displays via ProPresenter 8 and a YouTube stream via OBS.
Local LogoMesh plugins:

| Plugin                | Purpose                                                                                             | Key Phase-2 Resource Rules |

| `ProPresenterBridge`  | Reads slide changes ↔ injects auto-cue suggestions                                                  | Realtime CPU; 300 MB cap   |
| `WhisperLite-Stream`  | Low-latency ASR on mixer output                                                                     | <200 ms buffer, high CPU   |
| `VerseResolver-Nano`  | 0.5 GB quantised LLM + pattern engine that detects scripture refs in ASR text                       | 700 MB RAM                 |
| `VerseCache`          | SQLite DB with ESV + NIV + Greek interlinear; each verse embedded via VTC for rapid semantic lookup | Disk-bound, low CPU        |
| `ContextGraph`        | Builds on-the-fly visual graph of cross-references for post-service study                           | Low priority               |

#### Event Chain

* **09 : 55** Warm-up: `VerseCache` pre-loads sermon outline verses into RAM; ProPresenterBridge logs that manual advance is **operator-preferred** but auto-cue suggestions are allowed.

* **10 : 02 — Worship**

  * Lyrics still advanced by volunteer. VerseResolver idle, only Whisper streaming.

* **10 : 27 — Sermon begins**

  * Pastor launches into Romans 5:8 → John 3:16 → Genesis 22 chain.
  * **10 : 27:03** Whisper transcribes “Romans chapter five verse eight.” VerseResolver matches (confidence 0.93) and pushes a **cue proposal** to ProPresenterBridge:

    * Sanctuary TVs: full-screen verse in current Bible version (NIV).
    * Livestream: lower-third citation with rolling text.
  * Volunteer hits ⏎ to accept; slide switches instantly.
  * `ContextGraph` logs an edge Romans 5:8 → John 3:16 for later.

* **10 : 33 — Citation Burst**

  * Pastor rapid-fires six verses in 40 s. ProPresenter volunteer can’t keep up.
  * ProPresenterBridge detects **operator lag > 4 s**, escalates to *auto-advance* mode: accepted cues fire after 3-sec countdown unless manually vetoed.
  * Sanctuary TVs stay perfectly in sync; livestream overlays updated with <750 ms latency.

* **10 : 48 — Greek Word Deep-Dive**

  * Pastor: “The Greek word *charis* in Ephesians 2:8…”
  * VerseResolver grabs the Ephesians reference; VerseCache adds interlinear Greek row beneath English on livestream lower third only. TVs keep English-only layout.

* **11 : 05 — Discussion/Q\&A**

  * Wireless audience mic passed around. Some fail to state names; NameResolver tags as Guest#…
  * Attendee cites “that passage where Jesus says, ‘Fear not little flock.’” VerseResolver fuzzy-matches Luke 12:32 (confidence 0.78) and suggests it; volunteer eyeballs the preview, presses ⏎. Slide appears; audience nods appreciatively.

* **11 : 20 — Mic dropout**

  * Audience mic dies mid-question. Whisper silence detector triggers; VerseResolver suspends cue generation to avoid false triggers. SubtitleMixer displays subtle “audio lost” ribbon on stream; TVs unaffected.

* **11 : 52 — Service End**

  * VectorArchive writes searchable bundle: full transcript with time-aligned verse list, cross-reference graph (Romans → Genesis paths), and operator overrides.
  * ContextGraph snapshot auto-exports as PNG + JSON for small-group study. Volunteer downloads on USB; no internet required.

#### Why Phase 2 Must Nail These

| Capability                                           | Why It Matters in This Scenario                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Realtime ASR → VerseResolver pipeline (<1 s E2E)** | Keeps TVs & livestream synced with a scripture-dense speaker; manual ops can’t match speed.     |
| **Embedded local Bible DB + VTC embeddings**         | Enables fuzzy verse matching (“Fear not little flock”) without cloud calls; works offline.      |
| **Operator-override & auto-advance fallback**        | Human volunteer can pace slides but isn’t a bottleneck; system rescues them during bursts.      |
| **Multi-layout cue dispatch**                        | Same verse renders full-screen on sanctuary displays, lower-third on livestream simultaneously. |
| **Graceful degradation on mic drop**                 | VerseResolver pauses to avoid garbage cues; subtle stream-only overlay informs remote viewers.  |
| **Post-service knowledge graph export**              | Attendees later explore how Romans links to Genesis, reinforcing learning.                      |

With those Phase-2 guarantees, LogoMesh turns scripture overload into a seamless, educative experience—no frantic Bible flipping, no missed references, and a richer study resource waiting in everyone’s inbox Monday morning.
