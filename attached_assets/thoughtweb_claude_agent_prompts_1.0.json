ThoughtWeb is a local-first, tag-driven, cognitively-aligned thought network designed to help users visualize and evolve their own thinking. The system emphasizes emergence, persistent context, and AI interoperability. Our next phase includes integrating Cypher-based querying, MCP-style task routing, and local agent orchestration. All AI must remain user-activated or rule-triggered, not autonomous by default."
