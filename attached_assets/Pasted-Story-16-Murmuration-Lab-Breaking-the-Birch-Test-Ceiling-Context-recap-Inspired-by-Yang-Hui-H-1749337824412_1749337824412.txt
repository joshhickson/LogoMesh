Story #16 — “Murmuration Lab: Breaking the Birch-Test Ceiling”

Context recap
Inspired by Yang-Hui He’s “murmuration” discovery, a three-person maths squad wants LogoMesh to replicate (and surpass) that AI-guided pattern hunt—this time on a 12-million-curve dataset the LMFDB doesn’t even host publicly.
They’ll stress every Phase-2 guarantee plus the DevShell addendum (command-palette, security panel, smart-crash, rollback, pop-up VR).

Cast & gear

Role	Device	Key DevShell packs loaded
Prof Dana (number theorist)	MacBook Air M3 (on battery)	git, math-ai, sec-panel, vr-toggle
Vic (ML engineer)	2× A100 node on-campus	dataset-ingest, cuda-monitor, build, ai-assist
Naomi (PhD)	Quest 3 + desktop 4070	vr-holoviz, gesture-router, graph-scribe

All three share the same DevShell manifest and LogoMesh Core on a 64-core Linux host.

Plugin load-out (server side)

Plugin	Purpose	Phase-2 guardrails
CurveIngestor-Rust	Streams 12 M elliptic curves, computes first 128 Euler coefficients	Disk-spool; 1 GB RAM ring buffer
VectorStore-PGVec	Stores coefficient vectors & embeddings	WAL + batch commits
MurmurSeeker-PyTorch	Finds principal components → flags murmuration candidates	14 GB VRAM cap; pre-emptible
LLM-8B-Q8	Generates natural-language conjecture drafts & Birch-test checklist	8 GB VRAM; cache eviction
GraphIndex-Neo	Mirrors high-rank sub-graph for VR	600 MB RAM ceiling
SmartViz-Three	Streams graph tiles to Quest + web	Drops to 30 fps if GPU starved
AuditTrailSigner	Hash-chains every pipeline stage	Immutable log

Event chain — 48-hour Murmuration Sprint
	1.	Day 1 09 : 00 – One-command kick-off
Dana types:

devshell run murmuration --dataset=/mnt/disks/curves.tar.zst

DevShell expands to spawn CurveIngestor jobs on Vic’s A100 box. Security panel auto-flags “external dataset ingest” and encrypts hashes.

	2.	13 : 10 – Crash spike
A corrupted tar chunk throws a segfault in one worker. Smart-Crash isolates that worker, restarts it under new PID; ingest loss = 0.04 %. DevShell logs incident; no global downtime.
	3.	18 : 45 – Pop-up VR burst
Naomi issues devshell vr up --projection="pc1,pc2"; MatrixCore launches, pulling only the top two principal-component projections. Hand-gesture lasso reveals three dense oscillation bands exactly like He’s plot—but for rank 3 curves, previously unseen.
	4.	19 : 05 – NL conjecture draft
In VR Naomi says: “Summarise this band as a conjecture.”
LLM-8B retrieves vector hits, drafts:
“For curves C with conductor ≈ 10⁸ the vertical average of a_p … vanishes in mod-4 residue class 1.”*
Conjecture + sources appear in MacBook DevShell buffer.
	5.	Day 2 00 : 30 – Power dip
Campus UPS test drops desktop GPU; SmartViz downgrades to web-only wireframe; ingest pipeline unaffected.
	6.	Day 2 09 : 15 – Birch-test gate
Dana runs devshell birch-check --conjecture draft.md; LLM checklist shows:
Automatic = passes I (interpretation) via PCA script, N (new lines of inquiry) flagged “pending proof path”.
She toggles “chain-of-thought redact” in the security panel before sharing outside.
	7.	11 : 40 – Rollback rescue
Vic accidentally pushes a buggy CUDA kernel; Curves #7 M–7.8 M start returning NaNs. devshell undo 1 rolls pipeline to snapshot #1425; only 23 minutes of work lost.
	8.	18 : 00 – Export & shut-down
devshell audit export --range 48h --include vr produces:
	•	signed tar of ingest hashes
	•	GIF of VR lasso session
	•	conjecture.md with citations
	•	reproducible Jupyter notebook (autogenerated)
Containers park, freeing all GPUs.

Phase-2 & DevShell stress points proven

Stress point	Guardrail hit	Outcome
Massive dataset ingestion	WAL batches + 1 GB ring buffer	No RAM blow-out; single-worker crash contained
GPU contention (LLM vs. Viz)	Pre-emptible scheduling	LLM never starved Quest frame-rate
Security transparency	Chain-of-thought toggle + signed audit	External share passes info-sec review
Human-in-loop NL commands	birch-check, vr up shortcuts	Senior dev stays in shell 90 % of time
Rollback granularity	Snapshot diff at transaction level	CUDA mis-push undone in one command

Net effect: LogoMesh lets seasoned mathematicians stay keyboard-centric until the moment spatial intuition or AI drafting adds value—then VR and LLM fire up, do the heavy lift, and park again without leaving security gaps or GPU debris behind.
