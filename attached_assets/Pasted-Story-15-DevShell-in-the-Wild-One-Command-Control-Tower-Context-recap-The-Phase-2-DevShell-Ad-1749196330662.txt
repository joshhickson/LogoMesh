Story #15 — “DevShell in the Wild: One-Command Control Tower”

Context recap
The Phase-2 DevShell Addendum introduced a “living CLI” that sits on top of LogoMesh-Core:
	•	a command-palette pop-up (⌘/Ctrl + P) for natural-language commands,
	•	hot-swappable command packs (Git, Docker, LLM, VR),
	•	Security & Transparency Panel with per-command toggles (trace logging, chain-of-thought redaction, network sandbox),
	•	smart-crash isolation + history-aware rollback (devshell undo 3).

This story puts every item to work.

Cast & gear

Role	Device	Key DevShell packs loaded
Sara (Lead dev)	MacBook Pro M2	git, build, ai-assist, sec-panel
Jules (AI pair)	Headless 4090 tower	ai-assist, docker, gpu-monitor
QA bot (CI)	GitHub runner	unit-test, sec-panel

All three share the same DevShell manifest, so commands and security profiles stay in sync.

Event chain — One afternoon feature branch
	1.	14 : 03 Sara opens the project
devshell open branch=f/story-graphs
Prompt palette autocompletes; DevShell spawns a context bubble summarising open pull requests and failing tests.
	2.	14 : 07 Terminal drift alert
Jules (tower) runs devshell ai-suggest refactor IdeaManager. The Security Panel detects “accessing proprietary LLM weights” and requires Sara’s Yubikey sign-off—prevents silent data leak.
	3.	14 : 10 Chain-of-thought toggle
Sara types sec show → GUI flips up; she switches “LLM internal reasoning” → OFF for this run.
Jules’ AI helper now returns answers without raw chain-of-thought JSON—satisfying the team’s privacy policy.
	4.	14 : 18 Live build + crash
devshell build --watch triggers TypeScript compile. A rogue plugin eats 1 GB RAM and crashes.
DevShell Smart-Crash: logs the offending graphviz-render pack, auto-restarts only that pack, keeps the build alive.
	5.	14 : 22 Command-palette magic
⌘+P → “fix tslint warnings” (natural language). Palette rewrites to concrete shell:

eslint --fix src/**/*.ts
git add -u && git commit -m "style: lint fixes"

Sara hits ↵; DevShell executes in one transaction.

	6.	14 : 40 Quick rollback
The refactor breaks integration tests.
devshell undo 2 rewinds the last two DevShell transactions (lint commit + faulty code gen), without touching unrelated git history—rollback logic comes straight from the Addendum spec.
	7.	14 : 55 VR burst on demand
Sara needs a spatial view of new graph edges.
devshell vr up launches MatrixCore for 10 min, renders the service graph; on exit, vr down frees GPU instantly.
	8.	15 : 05 Audit export
devshell audit export --range 14:00-15:05 generates:
	•	signed command log (human-readable),
	•	smart-crash report,
	•	security-panel diff (showing chain-of-thought toggle).
QA bot attaches it to the pull request for compliance review.

Addendum features exercised

Addendum feature	Moment used
Command-palette + NL rewrite	Lint-fix shortcut (step 5)
Security & Transparency Panel	Chain-of-thought opt-out + Yubikey gate (steps 2-3)
Smart-Crash isolation	Rogue graphviz-render pack (step 4)
History-aware rollback	devshell undo 2 (step 6)
Ephemeral VR launch	vr up / down (step 7)
Signed audit trail	audit export (step 8)

Net effect: DevShell stays invisible when Sara is in flow, springs to life the moment she needs a higher-order command, and never endangers security or git hygiene. The addendum’s features prove essential rather than ornamental.
