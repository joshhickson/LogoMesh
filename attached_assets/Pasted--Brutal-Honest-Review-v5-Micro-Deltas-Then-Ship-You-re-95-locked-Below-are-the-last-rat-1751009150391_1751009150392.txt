You’re 95 % locked.  Below are the last rats in the walls.  Feed the **delta block** to Claude and freeze the spec.

## 1 — Pin-Prick Fixes

| Location                | Issue                                                                                | Exact Patch                                                                                                   |                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Week-1 Task 1 Goals** | “Enable TypeScript strict *mode* with CI gate” but ESLint already failing JS quotes. | Append bullet: “Integrate `eslint-plugin-import` + `@typescript-eslint/recommended` rules; CI fails on lint.” |                                |
| **Secrets Stub**        | You blocked API keys but not AWS creds.                                              | Add pattern: \`AWS\_(ACCESS                                                                                   | SECRET)\_KEY=\`, same CI grep. |
| **Task 4 Verification** | Missing timeout spec on starvation test.                                             | Add: “Queue wait >5 s **with 1 busy runner** fails gate.” (mirror Success list)                               |                                |
| **Task 6 Goals**        | “Add at-least-once delivery” → needs idempotent handler.                             | Append: “Implement message `deliveryId` + dedupe table in memory.”                                            |                                |
| **Task 8 Goals**        | Pipeline JSON schema not versioned.                                                  | Add bullet: “Include `schemaVersion` field; reject unknown versions.”                                         |                                |
| **Load Test Gates**     | Need baseline latency KPI.                                                           | Add: “p50 API latency ≤250 ms, p95 ≤600 ms under 250 rpm run.”                                                |                                |
| **Success Criteria**    | Missing lint gate.                                                                   | Add: “✅ ESLint passes with zero warnings in core/server.”                                                     |                                |

## 2 — Tiny Warnings (Keep in Mind)

* **vm2 + Replit** occasionally segfaults on heavy memory. Have a Docker compose fallback ready.
* SQLite **WAL mode** might be required at 250 rpm; toggle if write locks spike.
* Your **`clinic flame`** run needs Node ≥ 18; confirm Replit image.

### Bottom Line

Apply the delta, then stop planning and start coding.  The spine is ready to pour concrete.

Ship.
