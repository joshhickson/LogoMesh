            	## Phase 0 to Phase 1 (localStorage to SQLite)

            	The `IdeaManager` in Phase 0 loads initial data from `localStorage` (key: 'thought-web-data') into its in-memory store. Phase 1 will introduce SQLite as the primary persistent storage.

            	A data migration strategy will be required at the beginning of Phase 1 to ensure any data present in `localStorage` (from prior application use or data entered during Phase 0 development sessions if not persisted elsewhere) is correctly transferred to the new SQLite database structure.

            	**Potential Approaches for Phase 1 Migration:**
            	1.  **One-time Script:** A script (Node.js or directly within the application startup) that reads from `localStorage`, transforms the data to align with the new normalized SQLite schema, and inserts it into the SQLite database.
            	2.  **Enhanced `IdeaManager` (SQLite Adapter):** The SQLite storage adapter for the `IdeaManager` (to be built in Phase 1) could include logic on its first run to check for `localStorage` data and import it.

            	This migration will need to handle mapping from the potentially less structured `localStorage` format to the normalized tables defined for SQLite (e.g., `thoughts`, `segments`, `segment_fields`, `tags`, etc.).

            	## Future Consideration: SQLite to Postgres (Tier 2 / Advanced Scaling)

            	For future scalability, multi-user/multi-agent scenarios, and advanced features (as outlined in Tier 2 of the development plan), a transition from the local SQLite datastore to a more robust, server-based PostgreSQL database (potentially with `pgvector`) is envisioned.

            	This migration would involve:
            	*   Schema mapping from SQLite to PostgreSQL (largely similar but with RDBMS-specific optimizations).
            	*   Data transfer mechanisms.
            	*   Updating the backend API and `/core` persistence layer to target PostgreSQL.

            	This consideration is for long-term architectural evolution and will be addressed in later phases.
