### Story #6 — “The Distraction Detector Goes Live”

**Setup**

A small investigative-journalism collective deploys **LogoMesh-PsyOps** on a rented AMD EPYC server (32 cores, 128 GB RAM, RTX A4000 16 GB).
Activated plugins:

| Plugin                | Purpose                                                                    | Key Phase-2 Guarantees                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `NewsCrawler-Go`      | Scrapes + RSS-pulls \~2,000 mainstream & alt-news articles every 5 min     | Isolated Go sandbox; crashes can’t touch Python stack |
| `TweetStreamer-Rust`  | Fire-hose for blue-check tweets; de-dupes retweets                         | GPU-free, low-latency                                 |
| `VectorStore-PGVec`   | pgvector DB; every headline/body embedded via VTC                          | Multi-row atomic commit                               |
| `EventSpikeTracker`   | Time-series anomaly detector (PyTorch) watching topic clusters             | VRAM-capped                                           |
| `NarrativeLinker`     | Correlates spikes to political-legal calendar (court filings, WH schedule) | 2 GB RAM limit                                        |
| `PsyOpScoreModel`     | 7-B Q4 quant LLM that ranks *“probable distraction / framing”*             | Graceful KV-cache eviction                            |
| `DashboardNode-React` | Serves charts & heat-maps on the public site                               | Auto-reload if build crash                            |
| `RollbackCoordinator` | Orchestrates partial rewinds on bad ingest batches                         | Plugin-scoped                                         |

#### Event chain

* **12 : 00 UTC** System boot; NewsCrawler pulls first batch, embeds to VectorStore. Baseline spike matrix constructed.

* **14 : 17** White House press release: “Executive clemency granted…” (Hunter Biden).

  * NarrativeLinker logs **high-impact legal marker** for the day.

* **14 : 22 — Five-minute window later**

  * TweetStreamer sees “#DronesOverJersey” trending at +8,000 % over baseline; NewsCrawler shows 43 local TV stations syndicating the drone sighting with near-identical copy.

* **14 : 25** EventSpikeTracker flags two simultaneous anomalies:

  1. **Legal domain** (Biden pardon)
  2. **Public safety / UFO domain** (NJ drones)

* **14 : 26** PsyOpScoreModel prompt:

  ```
  ANALYZE {event_A}, {event_B}, contextual vectors, baseline noise. 
  Provide distraction likelihood 0-1, citing evidence (copy-paste similarity, timing, mention co-occurrence). 
  ```

  * Model returns **0.82 “High”** with explanation:
    “32/43 drone articles contain no by-line; publish timestamps cluster within 3 min of pardon notice; social amplification by blue-check accounts tied to same PR firm.”

* **14 : 27** DashboardNode emits red link **Drone Sighting ⇄ Pardon** on live graph. Public page shows tool-tips: “Correlation ≠ causation; model confidence 82 %.”

* **14 : 31 — Feed glitch**

  * Twitter API rate-limits; TweetStreamer panics. RollbackCoordinator:

    1. Pauses only TweetStreamer.
    2. Marks incoming spike metrics as *partial*.
    3. Keeps NewsCrawler + Model threads running.
    4. Queues a retry token after 60 s.

* **14 : 33** Retry succeeds; backlog tweets replayed chronologically; no data holes.

* **15 : 05** Another unrelated spike (celebrity death) appears; Model issues **0.21 “Low”** psy-op score, graph paints it grey—visually separate from high-suspect clusters.

* **23 : 59** Daily snapshot: all embeddings, anomaly graphs, and model outputs are compressed and uploaded to cold storage. RollbackCoordinator verifies checksum before cleaning temp tables.

#### Why Phase 2 Must Deliver

| Needed Feature                              | If Missing                                          | With Phase-2 Design                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-language plugin manifest**          | Go crawler crash could down the Python GPU tasks.   | Sandboxes + per-plugin watchdogs keep faults siloed.       |
| **Atomic vector ingest**                    | Half-written batches corrupt similarity search.     | RollbackCoordinator rewinds only the bad ingest TX.        |
| **GPU-budget guard + KV cache eviction**    | 7-B Q4 model could OOM and kill server.             | VRAM cap; evict cache, reload weights in 0.4 s.            |
| **Time-aligned anomaly detection pipeline** | Correlation windows mis-align, false positives.     | EventSpikeTracker & NarrativeLinker share clocked buffers. |
| **Live dashboard hot-reload**               | Front-end rebuild crash blanks the public site.     | DashboardNode auto-restarts; other services unaffected.    |
| **Transparent retry on API throttling**     | Single rate-limit knocks out entire insight stream. | TweetStreamer auto-backs off; data gap closed.             |

With these guarantees, LogoMesh-PsyOps delivers a real-time “narrative radar”—flagging suspicious alignment between high-stakes political moments and mass-media shiny objects, without collapsing when a scraper crashes or the Twitter hose hiccups.
