4. README.md
   - Added prominent setup documentation section
   - Updated prerequisites with version warnings
   - Added --python 3.11 flag to uv sync command
   - Linked to new setup guides

KEY ISSUES DOCUMENTED:
======================

1. Python Version Incompatibility
   - System default: Python 3.10.12
   - Required: Python 3.11-3.13
   - Cause: ray==2.53.0 wheels only for 3.11-3.13
   - Solution: Install Python 3.11 + use uv sync --python 3.11

2. Node.js Version Mismatch
   - System default: Node.js v12.22.9 (EOL)
   - Required: Node.js v20+
   - Cause: TypeScript 5.9 and modern ES2023 features
   - Solution: Install from NodeSource + remove libnode-dev

3. Docker Permission Requirements
   - Default: Requires sudo for all Docker commands
   - Documented: Both sudo approach and docker group addition

4. Package Installation Time
   - Python dependencies: ~5-10 minutes (3.5GB)
   - Node dependencies: ~3-5 minutes (500MB)
   - Total setup time: 15-20 minutes

RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED:
=========================

Critical (Pre-Competition):
- Update pyproject.toml: requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.14"
- Add .python-version and .nvmrc files
- Create unified setup script
- Add version warnings to README

Medium Priority:
- Create scripts/bash/setup_all.sh
- Add version checks to main.py
- Document Docker group addition
- Pin exact versions for critical dependencies

Low Priority:
- Add prerequisite checker script
- Create docker-compose.dev.yml
- Add .tool-versions for asdf
- Consider pre-built Docker images

TESTING COMPLETED:
==================

✅ Python 3.11.14 installation
✅ uv 0.9.26 installation and sync
✅ Node.js v20.20.0 upgrade from v12
✅ pnpm 8.15.7 via corepack
✅ Docker 28.5.1 access verification
✅ Virtual environment creation (.venv)
✅ 234 Python packages installed
✅ 553 Node packages installed
✅ main.py --help execution
✅ All version verification commands

DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE:
========================

For Judges/New Users:
1. Start with QUICK_SETUP.md (TL;DR)
2. Follow SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed steps
3. Reference JUDGES_START_HERE.md for competition context

For Technical Team:
1. Review TECHNICAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md for issues
2. Prioritize fixes based on Implementation Priority section
3. Implement suggested improvements

For Troubleshooting:
1. Check SETUP_GUIDE.md troubleshooting section
2. Compare versions with Quick Verification commands
3. Reset environment using documented commands

NEXT STEPS:
===========

Immediate (Before Competition Judging):
[ ] Review and approve documentation
[ ] Test setup on fresh Lambda instance
[ ] Consider implementing unified setup script
[ ] Update pyproject.toml version constraint
[ ] Add .python-version and .nvmrc files

Post-Competition:
[ ] Implement remaining recommendations
[ ] Create automated setup testing
[ ] Consider Docker-first approach
[ ] Add version compatibility tests
