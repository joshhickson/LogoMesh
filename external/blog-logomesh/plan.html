        <h1>Project Plan: The Contextual Debt Evaluator - AgentBeats Green Phase</h1>
        <p>Welcome, team! This document is our strategic guide to winning the AgentBeats Green Phase. It outlines our vision, our plan to address critical gaps in our project, our new architecture, our roles, and our week-by-week timeline to the submission deadline. Let's build something amazing together.</p>

        <h2>1. Project Vision & Competitive Edge</h2>
        <p>Our project is a <strong>Green Agent</strong>: a sophisticated evaluator designed to solve a critical problem in AI-generated code: the lack of discernible human intent, or <strong>"Contextual Debt."</strong> While other benchmarks focus only on whether code <em>works</em>, our agent asks a more important question: is the code <em>good</em>? Is it well-architected, clearly-reasoned, and thoroughly tested?</p>
        <p>Our competitive edge lies in our novel <strong>"Agent-as-a-Judge"</strong> philosophy. We are not just building a static tool; we are building an intelligent system that analyzes the <em>process and quality</em> of an AI agent's work. This innovative approach aligns perfectly with the competition's goal of creating "shared public goods" that push the entire field of agentic AI forward. We have a strong foundation, and with a focused effort, we can turn this powerful concept into a winning submission.</p>

        <h2>2. Our Mission: Closing the Gaps</h2>
        <p>The recent Gap Analysis Report gave us a clear, actionable roadmap. Our mission is to systematically address every "Area for Improvement" identified in that report. Here is our plan:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem: Critical Gap in Sponsor Alignment (Auth0)</strong>
                <p><strong>Our Plan:</strong> We will pivot from our homegrown JWT solution to a deep, meaningful integration of <strong>Auth0 for AI Agents</strong>. This is not just about checking a box; it's about making security a core, indispensable feature of our benchmark.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> The agent being tested (the "Purple Agent") will be required to interact with resources and tools that are secured by Auth0's Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA). Our Green Agent will evaluate how well the Purple Agent navigates this complex, realistic security model. This transforms our project into a powerful case study for the competition's lead sponsor.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Problem: Lack of a High-Stakes Problem Domain</strong>
                <p><strong>Our Plan:</strong> We will reframe our project's narrative. "Contextual Debt" is a brilliant concept, but it's too abstract. We will apply it to a specific, high-stakes domain that makes our project's value immediately obvious.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> We will choose a compelling domain like <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>. Our project will become the <strong>"Cyber-Sentinel Agent,"</strong> a benchmark that evaluates AI agents on their ability to generate secure, auditable, and well-documented code for cybersecurity tasks (e.g., writing secure authentication logic, patching vulnerabilities). This narrative is exciting, commercially relevant, and aligns with the security focus of our Auth0 integration.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Problem: Insufficient Architectural Innovation</strong>
                <p><strong>Our Plan:</strong> We will evolve our agent's architecture from a simple, single LLM call into a sophisticated <strong>multi-agent system</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> We will implement an <strong>Orchestrator-Worker pattern</strong>. An Orchestrator agent will manage the evaluation workflow, delegating tasks to specialized Worker agents (our existing analyzers). This demonstrates a deeper understanding of agentic design and makes our system more robust, scalable, and innovative.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Problem: Incomplete Implementation of Core Logic</strong>
                <p><strong>Our Plan:</strong> We will move beyond mock data and fully implement the core analysis logic.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> The <code>architecturalDebtAnalyzer.ts</code> will be integrated with a real static analysis library (e.g., <code>escomplex</code>) to provide credible, data-driven scores. All analyzer components will be production-ready.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Problem: Weak Demonstration of Trust and Safety</strong>
                <p><strong>Our Plan:</strong> We will build features that make our evaluation process transparent and auditable.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> We will implement a structured logging system that creates a clear, human-readable audit trail for every evaluation. This log will record the inputs, the LLM's reasoning, and the final scores, making our agent's judgments verifiable: a key principle of responsible AI.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. The New Architecture: From Monolith to Multi-Agent</h2>
        <p>To address the architectural gap, we are moving to a more powerful and scalable multi-agent design. The diagrams below illustrate this evolution.</p>
        <h3>Current Architecture</h3>
        <p>This is what our system looks like now: a single agent making a direct call to an LLM.</p>
        <pre><code>
graph TD
    A[Green Agent Server] --> B{RationaleDebtAnalyzer};
    B --> C[LLM API];
    C --> B;
    B --> A;
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Proposed Architecture</h3>
        <p>This is what we will build: a collaborative team of agents. This design is more innovative, robust, and aligns with advanced agentic principles.</p>
        <pre><code>
graph TD
    subgraph Green Agent System
        A[API Endpoint] --> B[Orchestrator Agent];
        B --> |1. Decompose Task| C{Rationale Analyzer Worker};
        B --> |1. Decompose Task| D{Architecture Analyzer Worker};
        B --> |1. Decompose Task| E{Testing Analyzer Worker};

        C --> F[LLM API];
        D --> G[Static Analysis Tool];
        E --> H[Test Execution Sandbox];

        subgraph Security & Audit
            I(Auth0 FGA) -.-> H;
            J[Audit Logger] <-.-> C;
            J <-.-> D;
            J <-.-> E;
        end

        F --> C;
        G --> D;
        H --> E;

        C --> |2. Report Results| B;
        D --> |2. Report Results| B;
        E --> |2. Report Results| B;

        B --> |3. Aggregate & Finalize| K[Final Report];
    end
        </code></pre>

        <h2>4. Our Team: Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>This project is a team effort. We have designed eight roles to give every member ownership over a critical area. Each role is a learning path, providing a unique opportunity to develop valuable skills.</p>
