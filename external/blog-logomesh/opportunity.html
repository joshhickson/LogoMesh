            <h2>The Generative AI Paradox</h2>
            <p>Generative AI has transformed software development, but it has created a paradox: while code generation is faster than ever, the resulting code is often brittle, opaque, and difficult to maintain. This is because AI, in its current form, is a "contextual debt accelerator."</p>
            <p>The business impact of this debt is severe, leading to degraded time-to-market, increased defect rates, and crippled onboarding for new engineers. The solution is not to slow down, but to build better tools.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="solution">
            <h2>A New Class of Tooling: Contextual Debt Analyzers</h2>
            <p>The crisis of AI-generated code requires a new class of tooling that moves beyond traditional linters and static analysis. "Contextual Debt Analyzers" are the next frontier in developer tooling, focused on automating the enforcement of intent, rationale, and domain knowledge.</p>
            <p>These tools are not a compliance tax; they are a productivity multiplier. By integrating directly into the developer workflow, they provide a "Contextual Integrity Score" that gives immediate, actionable feedback on every pull request, transforming passive architectural documents into an active, automated governance system.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="market">
            <h2>The Market Opportunity</h2>
            <p>The first wave of AI developer tools focused on <em>code generation</em>. The second, higher-value wave will focus on <em>code comprehension</em> and <em>governance</em>.</p>
            <p>As AI generates more code, the value of tools that make that code understandable, maintainable, and human-friendly becomes the fundamental prerequisite for sustained, long-term developer velocity. This is the market for Contextual Debt Analyzers, and it represents the next high-growth frontier in the developer tools market.</p>
