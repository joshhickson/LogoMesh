            <h1>The Breakthrough: The Cyber-Sentinel Agent</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">To fight a new class of AI-generated flaws, we need a new class of AI-driven defense. Our breakthrough is the <strong>Cyber-Sentinel Agent</strong>, a specialized evaluator designed not to find bugs, but to audit for <em>intent</em>.</p>
            
            <h2>A New Paradigm for Security</h2>
            <p>Our current security paradigm is broken. We cannot solve an AI velocity problem with more human review or more static scans. The Cyber-Sentinel Agent represents a new category of "AI-Native SAST" (Static Application Security Testing) that is built from the ground up to reason across users, data, and permissions, and to catch the subtle, context-dependent vulnerabilities that traditional tools miss.</p>
            
            <h2>The Three Pillars of Contextual Integrity</h2>
            <p>The Cyber-Sentinel Agent provides a holistic "Contextual Integrity Score" for any AI-generated code, based on three core pillars of measurement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rationale Integrity:</strong> Does the code's purpose align with the documented business rationale and human intent?</li>
                <li><strong>Architectural Integrity:</strong> Does the code adhere to the system's established architectural patterns and constraints?</li>
                <li><strong>Testing Integrity:</strong> Does the test suite validate the <em>semantic intent</em> of the requirements, not just achieve superficial line coverage?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Architecting Accountability</h2>
            <p>The Cyber-Sentinel Agent is built on a modern, multi-agent "Orchestrator-Worker" architecture. This "glass box" approach externalizes the agent's reasoning process, making it inherently auditable and accountable. This is not just a better way to build agents; it's a better way to govern them.</p>
