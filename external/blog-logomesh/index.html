            <h1>Building the Cyber-Sentinel Agent</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">A specialized evaluator agent designed not to find bugs, but to audit for <em>intent</em>. We are creating the benchmark for the next generation of secure, reliable, and trustworthy AI.</p>

            <h2>The Problem: Contextual Debt as a Security Liability</h2>
            <p>The foundational thesis of our research is <strong>Contextual Debt</strong>: <em>"the future cost incurred from a lack of discernible human intent, architectural rationale, and domain-specific knowledge within a codebase."</em></p>
            <p>With the rise of AI-generated code, this is no longer a passive maintenance issue. Contextual Debt has transformed into an active, escalating, and largely invisible <strong>security liability</strong>. You cannot secure what you do not understand.</p>
            <p><strong>To understand why this is a critical issue for all developers, read our introductory article: <a href="amnesia.html">Your Code Has Amnesia</a>.</strong></p>

            <h2>Our Solution: The Three Pillars of Contextual Integrity</h2>
            <p>Our Cyber-Sentinel Agent is built to fight this new class of AI-generated risk. It moves beyond traditional static analysis to audit for <em>intent</em>, providing a holistic "Contextual Integrity Score" for any AI-generated code.</p>
            <p>The score is derived from three core pillars of measurement:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Rationale Integrity</h3>
                    <p>Does the code's purpose align with the documented business rationale and human intent?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Architectural Integrity</h3>
                    <p>Does the code adhere to the system's established architectural patterns and constraints?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Testing Integrity</h3>
                    <p>Does the test suite validate the <em>semantic intent</em> of the requirements, not just achieve superficial line coverage?</p>
                </li>
