This folder contains documentation files that have been archived for historical reference but are not actively used in current development.

## Archive Date

## Rationale for Archiving

These files were archived because they:
1. Are duplicates of existing documentation
2. Represent completed phases of development
3. Have been superseded by more current documentation
4. Are legacy formats no longer actively maintained
5. Contain outdated information that could cause confusion

## Access

These files remain accessible for historical reference but are not part of the active documentation set. If any archived file needs to be restored to active use, it can be moved back to the appropriate location in the main docs folder.
