# LogoMesh Project Scope

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 2 Infrastructure Development

## Vision Statement

> A recursive thought engine for humans and AI â€” designed to evolve meaning, resolve contradictions, and externalize self-reflection.

LogoMesh is a **local-first, AI-augmented cognitive framework** that helps individuals and small teams transform scattered thoughts into structured insight through visual, filterable thought networks.

## What LogoMesh IS

### Core Purpose
- **Personal cognitive sovereignty** - Tools that amplify individual thinking
- **Small-scale collaboration** - Teams, classrooms, research groups (2-50 people)
- **Transparent AI partnership** - AI that shows its work and thinks WITH users
- **Local-first architecture** - Your data, your control, your cognitive process

### Target Users
- **Individual researchers** exploring complex questions
- **Small activist networks** preserving cognitive diversity
- **Educational environments** (classrooms, coding bootcamps)
- **Creative professionals** working on narrative/research projects
- **Small development teams** needing better coordination tools
- **Personal knowledge workers** building external memory systems

### Core Capabilities (Current & Planned)
- **Thought Bubbles & Segments** - Visual organization with nested detail
- **Multi-attribute Classification** - Flexible metadata and filtering
- **Local AI Integration** - LLM assistance that runs on your machine
- **Graph Visualization** - Interactive networks of interconnected ideas
- **Export/Import** - JSON-based data portability and transparency
- **Plugin System** - Extensible local-first architecture

## What LogoMesh is NOT

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- **Large-scale institutional governance** - Not for UN, government agencies, or corporate AI systems
- **Centralized cloud services** - No mandatory cloud dependencies
- **Social media platforms** - Not building viral sharing or engagement systems
- **Enterprise SaaS** - Not targeting Fortune 500 deployment
- **Mass surveillance tools** - No tracking, profiling, or behavioral manipulation
- **Replacement for established AI** - Not competing with Google, OpenAI for institutional use

### Scale Boundaries
- **Individual to small team focus** (1-50 users maximum per instance)
- **Local-first infrastructure** (works offline, owns your data)
- **Human-readable transparency** (no black box decision making)
- **Peer-to-peer networking** (when multi-user, direct connections)

## Phase 2 Development Scope

### Current Focus: Infrastructure Foundations
We're building the **plumbing** that enables cognitive features, not the full AI activation:

#### IN PHASE 2 SCOPE
- **Vector Translation Core (VTC)** - Local embedding and similarity foundations
- **MeshGraphEngine** - Semantic traversal and clustering infrastructure  
- **DevShell Environment** - Local development and plugin testing tools
- **Audit Trail System** - Transparent decision logging and explainability
- **Plugin Runtime** - Multi-language local plugin execution
- **Task Engine** - Workflow orchestration and pipeline management
- **Mock AI Systems** - Scaffolding for Phase 3 activation

#### NOT IN PHASE 2 SCOPE
- **Full LLM activation** - Advanced AI features wait for Phase 3
- **Real-time multi-user** - Focus on single-user infrastructure first
- **Cloud integrations** - Local-first foundations take priority
- **Production deployment** - Development infrastructure focus

### Architecture Principles

#### Local-First Design
- **Your data stays with you** - SQLite, local files, offline-capable
- **No phone-home requirements** - Core features work without internet
- **Transparent operations** - You can inspect how everything works
- **Plugin modularity** - Extend without vendor lock-in

#### Human-Scale Technology
- **Individual cognitive amplification** over mass automation
- **Small team collaboration** over enterprise scaling
- **Transparent AI assistance** over black box intelligence
- **Cultural thinking diversity** over cognitive homogenization

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] **Local development environment** functional for plugin creation
- [ ] **Audit system** provides complete traceability of all operations
- [ ] **VTC foundation** enables semantic search and similarity locally
- [ ] **Mock AI systems** demonstrate cognitive features without full activation
- [ ] **Plugin runtime** supports Go/Rust/Python/JS plugin development
- [ ] **Documentation** enables new developers to contribute

### Long-term Vision Metrics
- **Individual empowerment** - Users report better thinking and insight
- **Cognitive sovereignty** - People maintain control over their thinking tools
- **Educational impact** - Classrooms and small groups benefit from collaborative thinking
- **Cultural preservation** - Diverse thinking styles supported, not homogenized
- **Local AI adoption** - People run cognitive assistance on their own hardware

## Strategic Positioning

### What Makes LogoMesh Unique
- **Cognitive transparency** - AI that shows its reasoning process
- **Local intelligence** - Advanced features without cloud dependency  
- **Human-scale focus** - Designed for individuals and small teams
- **Cultural respect** - Preserves diverse thinking styles rather than standardizing
- **Extensible architecture** - Plugin system enables community innovation

### Competitive Landscape
- **Not competing with** Google, OpenAI, Microsoft for enterprise AI
- **Not competing with** Notion, Obsidian for general note-taking
- **Complementing** local AI tools like Ollama, llama.cpp
- **Pioneering** transparent cognitive partnership and local-first AI

## Development Philosophy

### Core Values
- **Prefer traceable structure over guesswork**
- **Design for recursive insight, not just information**
- **Build tools that evolve with your cognition**
- **No black boxes - make the system think out loud**
- **Treat AI as a partner in reflection, not just prediction**
- **Anticipate future collaboration and modularity**

### Technical Approach
- **Modular architecture** - Each component works independently
- **Interface-driven design** - Clear contracts between systems
- **Local-first storage** - SQLite and file-based persistence
- **Progressive enhancement** - Core features work without advanced AI
- **Plugin extensibility** - Community can add specialized capabilities
