i pushed changes to the dev branch that uses red agent for cis calculation

josh — 8:20 PMTuesday, January 13, 2026 8:20 PM
I’ll make sure to transfer the logic once I push to a new working branch; can you give a general summary of what you did so I can extract the logic?

aeduee — 8:20 PMTuesday, January 13, 2026 8:20 PM
red agent is still a wrapper for now, its mostly for representing the vulnerabilities that red agent points out in green agent evaluation

aeduee — 1:57 AM

josh — 1:58 AM
Yup, redownloading the files that you changed in your last 2 commits (one 54min ago, one just now)
Thank you
This is extremely helpful because I was ignoring the red agent functionality
