## Task: Initialize a new pnpm monorepo

Today, I successfully initialized the new pnpm monorepo structure for the LogoMesh project. This is a critical step in establishing a clean and maintainable codebase.

### Progress:

- **Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml`**: This file defines the root of the monorepo and the location of the packages.
- **Created root `package.json`**: The main `package.json` was created with the necessary scripts and development dependencies for the entire workspace.
- **Created Package Structure**: The directory structure for all the packages (`core`, `server`, `contracts`, and `frontend`) was created under the `packages/` directory.
- **Created Package `package.json` files**: Each package now has its own `package.json` file, giving it a unique identity within the monorepo.
- **Installed Dependencies**: Ran `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies and link the workspace packages. A `.gitignore` file was also created to prevent `node_modules` from being committed.

The monorepo is now fully initialized and ready for development.
