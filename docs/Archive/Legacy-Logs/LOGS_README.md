# Log Directory Structure

This directory contains logs, research, and other documents related to the LogoMesh project. It is organized into the following subdirectories to ensure clarity and easy access to information.

## `/ip_and_business`

**Purpose:** Contains documents related to the project's core intellectual property, business strategy, and commercialization plans.

This folder houses the foundational documents that define "Contextual Debt," the "Contextual Integrity Score (CIS)," and the "Agent-as-a-Judge" system. It also includes meeting minutes, strategic plans for IP protection (patents, trademarks), and materials for investor discussions.

## `/competition`

**Purpose:** Holds all materials related to the AgentX AgentBeats competition.

This includes the strategic analysis of the competition, gap analyses of our submission, and the tactical plans for aligning the project with the competition's goals and judges' interests. The core "Cyber-Sentinel Agent" narrative is detailed in the documents found here.

## `/technical`

**Purpose:** A log of all technical development, debugging, and architectural planning.

This is the home for technical roadmaps, recovery plans, analyses of build failures or bugs (like the `isolated-vm` and `redis` issues), and verification reports. It provides a detailed history of the project's engineering progress and challenges.

## `/research`

**Purpose:** A collection of research papers, analyses, and external insights that inform the project's theoretical foundation.

This folder contains the original "Contextual Debt" research paper, analyses of related academic work (e.g., from Berkeley's AI MOOC or papers by leading researchers), and logs of the iterative process of refining the project's core concepts.

## `/archive`

**Purpose:** Contains older, timestamped logs that are kept for historical purposes but are not part of the active strategic pillars.

This folder is for any log file that does not have a clear, descriptive name or does not fit into the primary categories. It serves as a historical record.
