## Task: Implement the full CI/CD pipeline and the "Covenant of Automated Enforcement."

Today, I have implemented the full CI/CD pipeline for the LogoMesh project using GitHub Actions. This pipeline is the cornerstone of our commitment to quality and will enforce our architectural and coding standards automatically.

### Progress:

- **Created GitHub Actions Workflow**: A new workflow has been created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This workflow defines three jobs: `install_and_build`, `lint_and_test`, and `security_audit`.
- **Implemented Architectural Boundary Checks**: I have installed `dependency-cruiser` and configured it with a rule in `.dependency-cruiser.js` that prevents the frontend from depending on the backend (server or core).
- **Configured Linter**: An `.eslintrc.json` file has been created to enforce a strict "no-any" policy, which will help to improve the type safety of our codebase.
- **Updated `package.json`**: The root `package.json` has been updated with the necessary scripts (`build`, `lint`, `lint:strict`, `check:boundaries`, and `test`) to run the CI checks. Placeholder `build` scripts have also been added to each of the sub-packages.

The "Covenant of Automated Enforcement" is now in place and will be active on all future pushes and pull requests.
