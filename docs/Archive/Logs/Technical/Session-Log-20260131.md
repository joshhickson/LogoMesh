# Session Log: Dual-Track-Arena Documentation Update (2026-01-31)

## Accomplishments
- Completed empirical review and update of all documentation and code in Dual-Track-Arena, green-agent, red-agent, and archive folders.
- Archived deprecated and legacy folders (agentbeats-lambda, 02-Engineering, 03-Research, Intent-Log, Specs, Team, Business, Competition, Diagrams, onboarding) to docs/Archive for clarity and compliance.
- Created and datemarked an archived copy of the master truth source (00_CURRENT_TRUTH_SOURCE_20260131.md).
- Verified all referenced filepaths in docs/00_CURRENT_TRUTH_SOURCE.md are valid and up-to-date.
- Confirmed all documentation, review logs, and specs are present and empirically verified.
- Pushed all changes to master and validated repository state.

## Suggested Next Course of Action
- Review and update the abstract and high-level strategy documents to reflect the new documentation structure and empirical review outcomes.
- Audit the docs/Archive folder for any files that can be further condensed or removed to reduce clutter.
- Begin preparing a public release or ReadTheDocs migration, ensuring all headers and YAML frontmatter are standardized.
- Schedule a team review to validate the new documentation and archive structure, and to plan next steps for competition submission or further development.
