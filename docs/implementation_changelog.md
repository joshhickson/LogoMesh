# ThoughtWeb Implementation Changelog

## Current Implementation Status (as of latest update)
The application currently implements:

1. Local-first storage architecture
- Browser's localStorage for data persistence
- In-memory graph representation with Maps
- Field type inference and persistence
- JSON import/export capabilities

2. UI Components
- React Flow for graph visualization
- Dark/Light mode theming
- Thought bubbles with segments
- Tag-based filtering
- Field type-aware filtering

3. Data Structure
- Thoughts as primary nodes
- Segments as sub-components
- Tags for categorization
- Type-aware fields (date, numeric, location, text)
- Event-driven updates

4. Core Features
- Dynamic thought creation/editing
- Segment management
- Field type inference
- Tag-based filtering
- Type-specific field filtering
- JSON import/export
- Dark mode support

## Event System Implementation
Added event bus system for component communication:

1. Created eventBus.js utility
2. Integrated with graph service
3. Added thought update broadcasting

Key files modified:
- src/utils/eventBus.js
- src/services/graphService.js

## Graph Visualization
Enhanced graph data structure and visualization:

1. Thoughts as nodes with dynamic positioning
2. Relationships between thoughts
3. Segment hierarchies within thoughts
4. Field type-aware filtering

## Type-Aware Filtering Implementation
Added sophisticated filtering capabilities:

1. Field type inference (date, numeric, location, text)
2. Type-specific filtering logic
3. Dynamic filter UI controls
4. Persistence of field types

Key files modified:
- src/services/graphService.js
- src/components/Sidebar.jsx
- src/components/ThoughtDetailPanel.jsx

## Current Technical Stack
- React + Tailwind (UI Framework)
- React Flow (Node Visualization)
- Local Storage (Data Persistence)
- Event Bus (Component Communication)

## Schema Structure
Current implementation uses the following data structure:

```json
{
  "thoughts": [
    {
      "thought_bubble_id": "unique_id",
      "title": "Thought Title",
      "description": "Description",
      "tags": [],
      "segments": [
        {
          "segment_id": "unique_id",
          "title": "Segment Title",
          "content": "Content",
          "fields": {}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Dependencies
- react-flow-renderer: Graph visualization
- ulid: Unique ID generation
- tailwindcss: Styling
- jest/testing-library: Testing framework

This changelog will be updated as new implementations are added.
