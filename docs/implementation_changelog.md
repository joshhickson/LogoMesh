# ThoughtWeb Implementation Changelog

## Local Storage Implementation
Replaced Neo4j with local storage for data persistence:

1. Added local storage integration in GraphService
2. Implemented data persistence methods
3. Added state hydration on startup
4. Added field type inference and persistence

Key files modified:
- src/services/graphService.js
- src/App.jsx

Changes include:
- Local storage setup with configurable state management
- Thought/segment persistence methods
- Field type detection and storage
- In-memory cache maintenance

## Event System Implementation
Added event bus system for component communication:

1. Created eventBus.js utility
2. Integrated with graph service
3. Added thought update broadcasting

Key files modified:
- src/utils/eventBus.js
- src/services/graphService.js

## Graph Visualization
Enhanced graph data structure and visualization:

1. Thoughts as nodes
2. Relationships between thoughts
3. Segment hierarchies within thoughts
4. Field type-aware filtering

## Type-Aware Filtering Implementation
Added sophisticated filtering capabilities:

1. Field type inference (date, numeric, location, text)
2. Type-specific filtering logic
3. Dynamic filter UI controls
4. Persistence of field types

Key files modified:
- src/services/graphService.js
- src/components/Sidebar.jsx
- src/components/ThoughtDetailPanel.jsx

## Current Technical Stack
- React + Tailwind (UI Framework)
- React Flow (Node Visualization)
- Local Storage (Data Persistence)
- Event Bus (Component Communication)

## Schema Structure
Current implementation uses the following data structure:

```json
{
  "thoughts": [
    {
      "thought_bubble_id": "unique_id",
      "title": "Thought Title",
      "description": "Description",
      "tags": [],
      "segments": [
        {
          "segment_id": "unique_id",
          "title": "Segment Title",
          "content": "Content",
          "fields": {}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Dependencies Added
- react-flow-renderer: Visualization
- ulid: ID generation
- tailwindcss: Styling

This changelog will be updated as new implementations are added.
