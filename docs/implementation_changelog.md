# ThoughtWeb Implementation Changelog

## Neo4j Integration Implementation
Added persistence layer using Neo4j graph database to replace in-memory storage:

1. Added Neo4j driver integration in GraphService
2. Implemented database initialization with constraints
3. Modified thought and segment storage to use Neo4j
4. Updated querying to use native Cypher instead of in-memory filtering

Key files modified:
- src/services/graphService.js
- src/App.jsx

Changes include:
- Neo4j connection setup with configurable credentials
- Thought/segment persistence methods
- Native Cypher query support
- Database constraint creation
- In-memory cache maintenance

## Event System Implementation
Added event bus system for component communication:

1. Created eventBus.js utility
2. Integrated with graph service
3. Added thought update broadcasting

Key files modified:
- src/utils/eventBus.js

## Graph Visualization
Enhanced graph data structure and visualization:

1. Thoughts as nodes
2. Relationships between thoughts
3. Segment hierarchies within thoughts

## Current Technical Stack
- React + Tailwind (UI Framework)
- React Flow (Node Visualization)
- Neo4j (Graph Database)
- Event Bus (Component Communication)

## Schema Structure
Current implementation uses the following data structure:

```json
{
  "thoughts": [
    {
      "thought_bubble_id": "unique_id",
      "title": "Thought Title",
      "description": "Description",
      "tags": [],
      "segments": [
        {
          "segment_id": "unique_id",
          "title": "Segment Title",
          "content": "Content",
          "fields": {}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Implementation Steps
1. UI Refinements
   - Enhanced segment editing
   - Improved field management
   - Better filtering controls

2. Data Layer
   - Query optimization
   - Batch operations
   - Export/import improvements

3. AI Integration
   - Field suggestions
   - Content analysis
   - Relationship inference

## Dependencies Added
- neo4j-driver: Graph database connectivity
- react-flow-renderer: Visualization
- ulid: ID generation
- tailwindcss: Styling

This changelog will be updated as new implementations are added.
