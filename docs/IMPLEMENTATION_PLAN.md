# Phase 2 Implementation Plan - Actionable Tasks

**Status**: ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS - Week 1, Task 1  
**Goal**: Build working infrastructure that Phase 3 can activate  
**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 completed (SQLite backend, React frontend, basic plugin scaffolding)

> **üìç Current Focus**: Week 1, Task 1 - Multi-Language Plugin Runtime (enhanced with specification goals)

## üö® Critical Reality Checks (Must Address Before Phase 2)

Based on architectural analysis, these issues will become major blockers if not resolved:

### Priority 0: Foundation Stability
- **56% TS / 42% JS = Maintenance Nightmare**: Complete TypeScript migration to 100% or define explicit JS sunset plan
- **LLM Layer Monolith**: Break down LLMOrchestrator into micro-actors to prevent single-point-of-failure
- **Security Gaps**: No JWT/session flow, no rate limiting, plugins can access filesystem - critical for any external deployment
- **Storage Abstraction Leak**: IdeaManager directly coupled to StorageAdapter - will break when adding vector DB

### Priority 1: Architectural Debt
- **Node-RED Scope Creep**: Decide if it's core automation or remove before it becomes unkillable
- **Testing Imbalance**: Backend needs load/fuzz tests, not just frontend mocks
- **Observability Blind Spots**: Need tracing before cognitive engines flood the system

## Week 1: Foundation Stability (Critical Path)

### Task 1: Complete TypeScript Migration + Security Foundation
**Framework Outcome**: 100% TypeScript codebase with basic security framework
