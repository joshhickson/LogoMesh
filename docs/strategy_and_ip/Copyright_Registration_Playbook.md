# Copyright Registration Playbook (v2 - GRUW Edition)

**Objective:** To register the core intellectual property of the LogoMesh project using the **Group Registration of Unpublished Works (GRUW)** option. This allows for up to 10 distinct unpublished works to be registered with a single application and fee, avoiding the risks associated with "compendium" submissions.

**Author/Claimant:** Joshua Hickson ("Josh")
**Registration Type:** Group Registration of Unpublished Works (Literary Works)

## Phase 1: Discovery & Selection (The Candidate Works)

**Goal:** Identify and prepare the specific documents that will form the "Contextual Debt" group.

Based on the initial inventory, the following documents are candidates for the group. Note that **all works must be unpublished** at the time of registration.

1.  **The Primary Protocol:** [docs/strategy_and_ip/20251118-Copyright-Edition-Contextual-Debt-Paper.md](docs/strategy_and_ip/20251118-Copyright-Edition-Contextual-Debt-Paper.md)
    *   *Description:* The foundational research paper defining "Contextual Debt" and the "Contextual Integrity Score."
2.  **The Core Definitions:** [docs/strategy_and_ip/01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md](docs/strategy_and_ip/01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md)
    *   *Description:* The specific definitions for the patentable methods (CIS and Agent-as-a-Judge).
3.  **The Business Narrative:** [docs/strategy_and_ip/03_INVESTOR_PITCH.md](docs/strategy_and_ip/03_INVESTOR_PITCH.md)
    *   *Description:* The commercial script outlining the market problem and solution.
4.  **The Technical Specification:** [logs/ip_and_business/20251118-Strategic-Pivot-Plan-CIS-Formalization.md](logs/ip_and_business/20251118-Strategic-Pivot-Plan-CIS-Formalization.md)
    *   *Description:* The detailed mathematical and architectural specifications for the CIS. (Consider registering this as a separate technical addendum if not fully merged into the Paper).

## Phase 2: Remediation (The Gap Analysis)

**Goal:** Ensure the works are "finished" and strategically aligned before registration. A registration fixes the work in time; we must ensure the "v1.0" we register is the strongest possible version.

**Critical Action:** Address the findings in the **Gap Analysis Report** ([docs/strategy_and_ip/DOC-REVISIONS/20251119-Gap-Analysis-Critique-vs-IP-Assets.md](docs/strategy_and_ip/DOC-REVISIONS/20251119-Gap-Analysis-Critique-vs-IP-Assets.md)).

*   **[x] 1. Formalize the Math:** Transfer the mathematical formulas for the Contextual Integrity Score (from the Technical Specification log) into the Research Paper. The registered paper must define a *protocol*, not just a rubric.
*   **[x] 2. Adjust the Tone:** Update the Research Paper to reflect the "Passive Authority" voice recommended in the Strategic Critique.
*   **[x] 3. Synchronize Definitions:** Ensure `01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md` is updated to match the new mathematical definitions in the revised Paper.
*   **[x] 4. Create the Diagram:** Add a definitive description (or textual representation) of the "Agent-as-a-Judge" data flow to the Paper.

## Phase 3: Execution (The GRUW Application)

**Goal:** Submit the group registration to the U.S. Copyright Office.

*   **[ ] 1. Prepare the Files:**
    *   Ensure all selected works (from Phase 1) are saved as separate, clean PDF files.
    *   Filenames should be descriptive (e.g., `01_Contextual_Debt_Paper.pdf`, `02_Core_IP_Definitions.pdf`).

*   **[ ] 2. Log in to eCO:**
    *   Access the Electronic Copyright Office (eCO) portal.
    *   Select "Register a Group of Unpublished Works".

*   **[ ] 3. Complete the Application:**
    *   **Title of Group:** Use a collective title, e.g., "Contextual Debt: Foundational Protocols and Business Methods".
    *   **Titles of Works:** Enter the title for each individual file (up to 10).
    *   **Author:** Joshua Hickson (for all works).
    *   **Claimant:** Joshua Hickson.
    *   **Year of Creation:** 2025.

*   **[ ] 4. Upload & Pay:**
    *   Upload the individual PDFs.
    *   Submit the single filing fee.

## Phase 4: Legal Entity & IP Transfer (Post-Registration)

**Goal:** Transfer the now-registered assets to the company.

*   **[ ] 1. Form the Entity:** Form "LogoMesh, LLC" (Delaware).
*   **[ ] 2. Execute Assignment:** Sign an "Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement" transferring the ownership of the registered Copyright Group from Joshua Hickson to LogoMesh, LLC.
*   **[ ] 3. Record the Transfer:** (Optional but Recommended) File a "Recordation of Transfer" with the Copyright Office to update the public record of ownership.
