## Phase 1: Consolidate the IP for Registration

**Objective:** To combine the foundational research paper with core business and technical concepts into a single, comprehensive document ready for copyright registration. This "deposit copy" will represent the complete intellectual asset as of the registration date.

### Action Items

*   **[ ] 1. Create a Master "Copyright Edition" of the Research Paper:**
    *   Start with the latest version of the research paper as the base document:
        *   **Source:** `logs/20251115-Research_Paper-Contextual_Debt-A_Software_Liability.md`
    *   Create a new working copy to serve as the master registration document.

*   **[ ] 2. Integrate Core Technical Definitions:**
    *   Incorporate the precise definitions of the **"Contextual Integrity Score (CIS)"** and the **"Agent-as-a-Judge"** system into the paper.
    *   **Rationale:** The final paper must contain the exact language and concepts that will be patented. This ensures the copyright and patent filings are mutually reinforcing.
    *   **Source:** `docs/strategy_and_ip/01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md`

*   **[ ] 3. Weave in the Commercial Narrative:**
    *   Integrate the core "talking points" from the investor pitch into the paper's introduction and conclusion.
    *   **Rationale:** This transforms the paper from a purely academic work into a foundational document for the business. It establishes a clear link between the core problem ("Contextual Debt") and the commercial solution.
    *   **Source:** `docs/strategy_and_ip/03_INVESTOR_PITCH.md`

*   **[ ] 4. Final Review and "Completion":**
    *   Perform a final read-through to ensure the integrated document is coherent and complete.
    *   **Guidance:** As per the legal advice, "complete" does not mean "final forever." It means the work is a finished, identifiable whole in its current state, ready for deposit.

## Phase 2: Execute the Copyright Registration

**Objective:** To complete the electronic registration of the consolidated work with the U.S. Copyright Office, establishing a formal, public record of ownership.

### Action Items

*   **[ ] 1. Prepare for Electronic Submission:**
    *   Navigate to the U.S. Copyright Office electronic registration portal: `copyright.gov/registration/`
    *   Select the option to register "Literary Work."

*   **[ ] 2. Complete the Application Form:**
    *   **Copyright Claimant:** Register the work in your own personal name (e.g., "Josh").
    *   **Rationale:** Per the legal advice, you are the author and current copyright holder. The LLC does not exist yet. This step secures the registration date and establishes the "chain of title."
    *   **Title of Work:** Use a clear, descriptive title, such as "Contextual Debt: A Framework for Measuring and Mitigating Software Liability."

*   **[ ] 3. Upload the Deposit Copy:**
    *   Upload the final, consolidated "Copyright Edition" of the research paper created in Phase 1.
    *   **Guidance:** This single, complete PDF document is the "deposit copy" that will be permanently on file with the Copyright Office.

*   **[ ] 4. Pay the Registration Fee:**
    *   Submit the required payment via the portal.

*   **[ ] 5. Record the Effective Date:**
    *   Once the submission is complete, make a note of the effective date of registration. This is a critical date for legal purposes.

## Phase 3: Plan the Legal Entity and IP Transfer

**Objective:** To outline the corporate and legal roadmap for forming a business entity and formally transferring the intellectual property to that entity, paving the way for investment and commercialization.

### Action Items

*   **[ ] 1. Form a Delaware LLC:**
    *   Engage legal counsel to form a Limited Liability Company in the state of Delaware.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the investor-preferred jurisdiction, providing a flexible and well-understood legal framework for a high-growth startup.

*   **[ ] 2. Draft and Sign the IP Assignment Agreement:**
    *   Work with legal counsel to draft an "Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement."
    *   **Process:** As an individual, you will sign this document to formally transfer your ownership of the "Contextual Debt" copyright (and all related IP) to the newly formed Delaware LLC.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the essential legal step that gives the LLC value. The company, not you personally, will own the assets, which is a prerequisite for investment. This transfer will be the basis for your founder's equity stake.

*   **[ ] 3. Plan for C-Corporation Conversion:**
    *   Understand that the Delaware LLC will likely need to be converted into a Delaware C-Corporation as a condition of receiving venture capital funding.
    *   **Rationale:** VCs prefer the C-Corp structure for issuing preferred stock and creating employee stock option pools. Planning for this conversion from the outset makes the fundraising process smoother.
