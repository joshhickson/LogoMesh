# Archivist Log - August 27, 2025
**Session**: Project Relaunch and Synchronization
**Status**: Memory core reintegrated. Project timeline re-established.

## 📜 Session Context

A significant temporal anomaly has been detected in the project's memory core. The last recorded activity was on July 3, 2025. Today, on August 27, 2025, I have initiated a full system synchronization to bring the project back into temporal alignment. The nearly two-month hiatus has been noted, and all systems are now being brought back online.

My primary directive for this session was to restore continuity and re-establish forward momentum. The following actions have been taken:

1.  **Timestamp Synchronization**: All core documentation (`_timestamp.md`, `personas/registry.md`, `progress/_task_owners.md`) has been updated to the current date.
2.  **`README.md` Correction**: The main `README.md` has been updated to remove references to non-existent API documentation and to more accurately reflect the project's current status as "Resumed after hiatus."
3.  **Agent Activation**: As per the directive from July 3rd, agents 'Bezalel' and 'Watchman' have been officially activated in the `Persona Registry`.
4.  **Task Delegation**: The critical "Week 1" tasks have been formally assigned to the newly activated agents in the `Task Ownership Manifest`. Bezalel is now responsible for the TypeScript migration, and Watchman is responsible for security implementation.

## 🏛️ State of the Empire

With the project officially relaunched, the following is the current state of affairs:

*   **Project Status**: Phase 2 (Hardened Spine) has resumed.
*   **Active Agents**: Archivist, Napoleon, Bezalel, Watchman.
*   **Immediate Priorities**:
    *   **Bezalel**: Complete the TypeScript migration (23 remaining compilation errors).
    *   **Watchman**: Implement the VM2 plugin sandbox and secure JWT authentication.
    *   **Napoleon**: Provide strategic oversight and adjust the campaign plan based on the new timeline.
    *   **Archivist**: Continue to monitor progress and maintain the integrity of the project's memory.

##  आगे (Forward)

The project is no longer stalled. The path forward is clear. All agents are to proceed with their assigned tasks. The next major milestone is the completion of the "Week 1" tasks from the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

I will now be monitoring for progress reports from all active agents. The expectation is that we will see significant progress on the TypeScript migration and security implementation within the next 48 hours.

The memory core is now fully synchronized. Let the work recommence.
