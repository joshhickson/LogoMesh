# Test Infrastructure Status Report - June 21, 2025

## Executive Summary
Test infrastructure is partially functional with 13% pass rate (4/31 tests). Core utilities working, but component testing blocked by mock configuration issues.

## Infrastructure Health ‚úÖ
- **Vitest Configuration:** Working properly
- **Test Execution:** Stable (6.67s avg runtime)
- **Global Setup:** Functional with comprehensive browser API mocks
- **Test Organization:** Well-structured test file hierarchy

## Critical Blockers üö®

### 1. API Service Mock Architecture Issue
- **Impact:** Blocks main App component testing
- **Root Cause:** Export structure mismatch between mock and actual service
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - Must fix first

### 2. Component Test Environment Issues  
- **Impact:** All React component tests failing
- **Symptoms:** DOM elements not found, props not passed correctly
- **Priority:** MAJOR - Affects entire component test suite

### 3. Speech Recognition API Mocking
- **Impact:** 6 VoiceInputManager tests failing
- **Issue:** Constructor mocking not working despite global setup
- **Priority:** MEDIUM - Isolated to specific feature

## Success Stories ‚úÖ
- **Utility Functions:** eventBus tests (3/3 passing)
- **Service Layer:** graphService tests (1/1 passing)  
- **Test Runner:** Stable execution without crashes
- **Mock Infrastructure:** Basic browser APIs working

## Error Logging Analysis
- **404 Errors:** Every 5 minutes from `/api/v1/admin/save-errors`
- **Impact:** None on test execution (only affects webview logs)
- **Cause:** Error logging system trying to save to missing backend endpoint

## Recent Improvements Made
1. ‚úÖ Fixed vi import issues across all test files
2. ‚úÖ Converted jest syntax to vitest in remaining files
3. ‚úÖ Created centralized mock setup in setup.js
4. ‚úÖ Enhanced browser API mocking in vitest.setup.ts

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Path (Immediate)
1. Fix apiService mock export structure in setup.js
2. Debug component rendering issues
3. Verify prop passing in test environment

### Phase 2: Component Coverage (Next)  
1. Ensure all components render basic elements
2. Test component interaction and state management
3. Validate event handling in test environment

### Phase 3: Feature Coverage (Later)
1. Fix speech recognition mocking
2. Add missing backend endpoints for error logging
3. Expand test coverage for edge cases

## Technical Metrics
- **Test Files:** 9 total (8 failing, 1 passing)
- **Individual Tests:** 31 total (27 failing, 4 passing)
- **Performance:** 6.67s execution time (within acceptable range)
- **Mock Coverage:** Browser APIs ‚úÖ, Service APIs ‚ö†Ô∏è, Component Props ‚ùå

## Environment Stability
- **Vitest Version:** Working with ESM configuration
- **JSdom Environment:** Properly configured
- **Replit Integration:** Stable test execution
- **File Watching:** Working for development workflow
