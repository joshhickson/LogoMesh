# Investor Pitch Script v2 (Protocol Edition)

This document contains the core talking points for investor meetings, aligned with the "Hard Tech" strategy defined in the `Contextual Debt Protocol` paper.

## The 7 Key Talking Points

1.  **The New Liability: The "Failure of Why"**
    *   "We’ve spent 20 years managing 'Technical Debt'—a failure of the 'how.' But the next decade of *liability* comes from 'Contextual Debt'—a 'failure of the 'why''. This is a massive, unmanaged risk, creating 'amnesiac systems' that are ticking time bombs in every enterprise."

2.  **The Accelerant: AI & Modern Complexity**
    *   "This problem is accelerating exponentially. The 'context-free, AI-generated code' and fragmented microservices that power modern business are also destroying the human *intent* and *rationale* behind them. Your developers are building 'unknowable code' faster than ever."

3.  **The Consequence: Indefensible Liability**
    *   "When this 'unknowable' code fails—not if, *when*—it's not a simple bug. It's a 'catastrophic system failure,' a 'data breach,' or a 'major accounting error'. In today's regulatory world, being unable to explain *why* your system did what it did is, in a word, 'indefensible'".

4.  **The Solution: The "Contextual Integrity Protocol"**
    *   "We have developed the 'Contextual Integrity Score' (CIS), a **computable probability function** that mathematically measures code risk. We don't just provide a dashboard; we generate a **Decision Bill of Materials (DBOM)**—a cryptographic record of the 'why' behind every line of code."

5.  **The "Magic": The "Glass Box" Architecture**
    *   "We've built the 'Agent-as-a-Judge,' a **Glass Box Protocol** that *evaluates* code in real-time. While other AIs are 'black boxes' that hallucinate risk, our **Orchestrator-Worker** system externalizes reasoning, enforcing architectural constraints and stopping catastrophic failures *before* they're deployed."

6.  **The Model: The "Consult-to-Product" Flywheel**
    *   "We are already signing high-margin consulting contracts to perform 'archeological code digs'. This *paid data acquisition* is building the world's only proprietary dataset of 'intent failure,' which serves as the unassailable data moat for our scalable SaaS platform."

7.  **The Ask: Own the GRC Standard for Software**
    *   "This is not a developer tool. This is a new category of enterprise risk management. We are raising $X million to become the mandatory, auditable standard for 'Contextual Integrity'—the 'Fair Isaac' for all software."
