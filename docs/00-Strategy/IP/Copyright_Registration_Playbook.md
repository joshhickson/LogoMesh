# Copyright Registration Playbook: Group Registration of Unpublished Works (GRUW)

**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Author:** Joshua Hickson (Team Lead)

## 1. Objective

To secure intellectual property protection for the "Contextual Debt" concept and the "Contextual Integrity System" (CIS) methodology by registering up to 10 distinct unpublished literary works with the U.S. Copyright Office under a single application (GRUW).

## 2. The Assets (The "Bundle")

We have selected the following 3 key assets for the initial bundle. These must be technically "unpublished" (not distributed to the public) at the time of registration.

1. **Contextual Debt: A Software Liability** (The Research Paper)
   - *Status:* **Drafting** (v3.0)
   - *Path:* [20251118-Copyright-Edition-Contextual-Debt-Paper.md](./20251118-Copyright-Edition-Contextual-Debt-Paper.md)
   - *Action:* Finalize Section 2.2 (Novelty Claim) and Section 3 (Methodology).

2. **Core IP Definition: The Contextual Integrity Score (CIS)** (The Spec)
   - *Status:* **Drafting**
   - *Path:* [01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md](./01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md)
   - *Action:* Ensure this document is distinct from the paper. It should read like a "Standard" (e.g., ISO spec).

3. **Investor Pitch: The Consult-to-Product Flywheel** (The Business Model)
   - *Status:* **Drafting**
   - *Path:* [03_INVESTOR_PITCH.md](./03_INVESTOR_PITCH.md)
   - *Action:* Ensure the narrative matches the "Pivot" (Green Agent) strategy.

## 3. The Process (GRUW)

### Phase 1: Preparation (Current Phase)
- [x] Create distinct files for each work.
- [ ] **Hardening:** Ensure all internal links are relative and working (Self-contained).
- [ ] **Review:** Legal review of the "Claims" in the paper (Section 2.2).
- [ ] **Manifest:** Create a final `REGISTRATION_MANIFEST.md` listing the exact filenames and titles.

### Phase 2: Consolidation
- Use a script to strip markdown links? Or submit as PDF?
- **Decision:** We will convert the final Markdown files to PDF for submission to ensure formatting is preserved.

### Phase 3: Registration
- Login to eCO (Electronic Copyright Office).
- Select "Register a Group of Unpublished Works".
- Upload the PDFs.
- Pay the fee ($85).
