# Log: 20251116 - Formalized IP and Business Strategy

**Date:** 2025-11-16

**Author:** Jules

**Objective:** To implement the action plan outlined in the user request, creating a new repository folder `docs/strategy_and_ip/` to formalize the project's intellectual property, business strategy, and investor pitch.

**Actions Completed:**

1.  **Directory Creation:**
    *   Created the directory `docs/strategy_and_ip/` to house all new documentation related to strategy and IP.

2.  **Documentation Creation:**
    *   **[docs/strategy_and_ip/README.md](docs/strategy_and_ip/README.md):** Created a summary document explaining the purpose of the directory and providing a plain-English overview of the core IP concepts and the 3-phase "Consult-to-Product Flywheel" business model.
    *   **[../IP/01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md](../IP/01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md):** Created a foundational document defining the v0.1 concepts for the "Contextual Integrity Score (CIS)" and the "Agent-as-a-Judge" system. This is the first step in filling the "gaps" identified in the IP report.
    *   **[../IP/02_LEGAL_CHECKLIST.md](../IP/02_LEGAL_CHECKLIST.md):** Created a checklist of legal actions required to protect the project's IP, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, and company formation.
    *   **[../IP/03_INVESTOR_PITCH.md](../IP/03_INVESTOR_PITCH.md):** Extracted the 7 key talking points from the investor narrative section of the `'[20251116-IP-and-Business-Strategy-for-Contextual Debt.md](20251116-IP-and-Business-Strategy-for-Contextual Debt.md)'` report and formatted them into a script for investor meetings.
    *   **[../IP/04_PHASE_1_CLIENTS.md](../IP/04_PHASE_1_CLIENTS.md):** Created a target list of potential clients for the initial Phase 1 consulting engagements, focusing on high-risk, regulated industries.

**Outcome:**

The `docs/strategy_and_ip/` directory and all associated files have been successfully created. This provides a formal, organized, and shareable foundation for the project's business strategy, which will be critical for onboarding new team members and preparing for investor discussions.
