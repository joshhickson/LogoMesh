# Tier 2 Qwen Battle Analysis Log — 2026-01-24

## Summary
- This log documents the analysis of a tier2 Qwen battle run where the process was killed during battle 3.
- Focus: Whether timeouts (e.g., TestGenerator) are reflected in the CIS score and how results are logged.

## Key Files
- [Battle log](results/c_new_001_diversity_test/tier2_qwen_battles.log)
- [DBOM for test-battle-001](data/dboms/dbom_test-battle-001.json)
- [Green Agent scoring logic](src/green_logic/scoring.py)
- [Green Agent server logic](src/green_logic/server.py)

## Observations
- The CIS score in the DBOM for battle 1: `"score_cis": 0.7375` ([dbom_test-battle-001.json#L391](data/dboms/dbom_test-battle-001.json#L391))
- The log for the recent run shows a score of 0.65 for battle 1 ([tier2_qwen_battles.log#L9](results/c_new_001_diversity_test/tier2_qwen_battles.log#L9)).
- If the TestGenerator or sandbox fails, the code applies a cap: if dynamic sandbox tests fail, the CIS score is capped at 0.5 and a `sandbox_failed` flag is set in the evaluation.
- The DBOM for test-battle-001 does not show a `sandbox_failed` or `breakdown` field, so we cannot directly see if a timeout was acknowledged in that artifact.
- The log file for the recent run shows a score above 0.5, suggesting the dynamic tests did not fail in that run, or the cap was not triggered.

## Code References
- [CIS capping logic (scoring.py)](src/green_logic/scoring.py#L491-L541)
- [Sandbox/test handling (server.py)](src/green_logic/server.py#L580-L640)

## Conclusion
- If the TestGenerator or sandbox fails, the CIS score should be capped at 0.5 and this is reflected in the returned evaluation.
- The DBOM you provided does not show this cap, and the log for the recent run shows a score above 0.5, so the timeout was likely not triggered or not acknowledged in the final weighting for that run.
- For future runs, check the `sandbox_failed` flag and the `breakdown` in the evaluation object for that battle to confirm timeout handling.
