# Technical Log: IP Strategy Refactoring (2025-11-20)

## 1. Overview
This log records the successful execution of the "Group Registration of Unpublished Works" (GRUW) strategy. The objective was to transform the project's intellectual property assets from a "Manifesto" style to a rigorous "Technical Protocol" style, securing the core "Contextual Debt" concepts before public release or registration.

## 2. Execution Summary

### A. Strategic Alignment
*   **Gap Analysis:** Created [../../../00-Strategy/IP/20251119-Gap-Analysis-Critique-vs-IP-Assets.md](../../../00-Strategy/IP/20251119-Gap-Analysis-Critique-vs-IP-Assets.md) to identify the discrepancies between the current assets and the "Strategic Critique." The key gaps were a lack of mathematical formalism and an overly "alarmist" tone.
*   **Transformation Map:** Created [../../../00-Strategy/IP/20251119-Transformation-Map.md](../../../00-Strategy/IP/20251119-Transformation-Map.md) to plan the specific refactoring steps. **Status: EXECUTED & COMPLETE.**

### B. Artifact Refactoring
The following core assets were modified to implement the "Protocol" strategy:

1.  **[../../../00-Strategy/IP/20251118-Copyright-Edition-Contextual-Debt-Paper.md](../../../00-Strategy/IP/20251118-Copyright-Edition-Contextual-Debt-Paper.md)**
    *   **Math Injection:** Replaced the v0.1 Rubric with formal vector-based equations for `R(Δ)`, `A(Δ)`, and `T(Δ)` (derived from the Pivot Plan).
    *   **Tone Shift:** Removed the historical "Technical Debt" context (Cunningham/Fowler) to focus purely on the new protocol.
    *   **Architecture:** Inserted "Figure 1: The Glass Box Protocol Topology" (Mermaid diagram) to visually define the system architecture.

2.  **[../../../00-Strategy/IP/01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md](../../../00-Strategy/IP/01_CORE_IP_DEFINITION.md)**
    *   **Synchronization:** Updated to "v0.2 - Protocol Edition," ensuring the definitions match the new formulas in the research paper.

3.  **[../../../00-Strategy/IP/03_INVESTOR_PITCH.md](../../../00-Strategy/IP/03_INVESTOR_PITCH.md)**
    *   **Language Update:** Revised the "Solution" and "Magic" slides to use the new terminology ("Glass Box," "DBOM," "Computable Function").

4.  **[../../../00-Strategy/IP/Copyright_Registration_Playbook.md](../../../00-Strategy/IP/Copyright_Registration_Playbook.md)**
    *   **Process Update:** Shifted the target from "Consolidated Master Document" to "Group Registration (GRUW)."
    *   **Checklist:** Marked the "Remediation" phase as complete.

### C. Registration Readiness
*   **Manifest Created:** A final checklist for submission was created at [../../../00-Strategy/IP/REGISTRATION_MANIFEST.md](../../../00-Strategy/IP/REGISTRATION_MANIFEST.md). This file lists the exact paths and titles for the eCO upload, confirming "Joshua Hickson" as the sole author.

## 3. Current Status
The project's IP documentation is now fully aligned with the "Hard Tech" strategy. The `Transformation-Map.md` has been fully processed, and the assets are ready for PDF conversion and upload to the U.S. Copyright Office.
