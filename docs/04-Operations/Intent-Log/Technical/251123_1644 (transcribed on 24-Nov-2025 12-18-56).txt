A specific idea I have relates to language differences. Everybody on the team can speak English pretty proficiently, but I think everybody would benefit if they were able to document their thoughts in their native language. 

For example, right now what I'm doing, I'm speaking into a simple voice recorder and then I'm transcribing this recording into a text document. So if I asked them to do something similar where they documented their thoughts in their native language and then they didn't have to worry about translation, that would be extremely helpful because it would allow them to think faster. So that might be helpful. It depends on whether or not they're thinking in English or not when they're reading over the documentation. Oh, also maybe having them translate documentation into their native language might help too. Kind of depends. I don't know. They're pretty smart people. They seem to speak English pretty fluently. So I'm not overly concerned about this idea. I don't think it's absolutely necessary. I also think there's a chance it would be offensive if I brought it up, so I'd have to figure out how to bring up this idea the right way. But I think it would really speed along teams working together. There's also the risk of accumulating contextual debt through mistranslations, so that's something that has to be addressed. 

Yeah, that's it.
