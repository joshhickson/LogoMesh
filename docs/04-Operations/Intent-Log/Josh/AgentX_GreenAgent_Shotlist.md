# AgentX Green Agent Video Submission: Cinematography Shotlist

## 0. Opening Title (0:00)
- **Visual:** Fade in to split screen: Left – messy code (highlighted errors), Right – clean code (but with a warning overlay "Wrong Purpose").
- **Action:** Slow zoom into center, fade to title: "The Crisis of Intent"

## 1. The "What & Why" (0:00–0:30)
- **Visual:**
  - Overlay animated text: "Technical Debt" and "Contextual Debt"
  - Cut to highlighted excerpt from research paper PDF ("Liability of Amnesiac Systems")
- **Action:**
  - Use PDF annotation effect to highlight key phrases
  - Show code editor with prompt: "Task: Implement a Rate Limiter... Constraint: Do not use global state."

## 2. The Architecture (0:30–1:00)
- **Visual:**
  - Animated architecture diagram: Green Agent (Assessor) <--> A2A Protocol <--> Purple Agent (Subject)
  - Docker logo watermark in background
  - Split terminal: Top pane – Purple Agent generating code; Bottom pane – Red Agent log with "[ATTACK] Injecting SQLi vector into context..."
- **Action:**
  - Highlight container boundaries with animated borders
  - Show launch_arena.sh script running in terminal (fast-forward effect)

## 3. The "Receipts" (1:00–2:00)
- **Visual:**
  - Terminal screen recording (accelerated 20x): Green Agent issuing task, code scrolling, "Analyzing Submission..."
  - Overlay log line: "CIS Calculation: R=0.8 A=0.7 T=1.0 L=0.9 => Final=0.85"
  - Large equation overlay: Score = 0.25R + 0.25A + 0.25T + 0.25L
  - Animated score drop: "0.85" in green, "Red Penalty" stamp, number counts down to "0.34" in red
- **Action:**
  - Use pop-up annotation for "Red Penalty" moment
  - Cut to PDF page showing methodology or scoring formula

## 4. Reproducibility & Leaderboard (2:00–2:45)
- **Visual:**
  - AgentBeats leaderboard (local replica): Bar chart/table showing Baseline Model (0.45) vs Advanced Model (0.82)
  - Histogram/boxplot of CIS scores (from database)
  - Animated overlays for outlier removal and bimodal distribution
  - Side-by-side terminal windows: "Run A" and "Run B" (identical tests)
- **Action:**
  - Highlight cryptographic hash and DBOM proof in terminal
  - Cut to PDF page showing reproducibility or scientific validation

## 5. Compliance & Closing (2:45–3:00)
- **Visual:**
  - Terminal: DBOM proof, cryptographic hash
  - Fade in "AgentBeats.dev" text
- **Action:**
  - Fade to black
  - Overlay final call to action: "Measure the 'Why', not just the 'How'"

## PDF Integration Notes
- Use the research paper PDF for:
  - Executive summary ("Liability of Amnesiac Systems")
  - Methodology and scoring formula
  - Scientific validation and reproducibility
- Use animated highlights and zooms to direct attention to key sections

---

## Cinematography Tips
- Use fast cuts and overlays to maintain pacing
- Ensure all technical visuals are legible (zoom, highlight, annotate)
- Use color cues: Green for success, Red for penalty/vulnerability
- Sync voiceover with visual transitions for maximum impact
