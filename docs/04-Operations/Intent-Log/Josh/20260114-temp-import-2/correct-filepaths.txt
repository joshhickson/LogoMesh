just prompted a purple agent to build a coinbase crypto coin

It's technically a separate track in the same competition, and teams can only participate in one track at a time. I had a teammate create a duplicate team and sign us all up for the lambda track since we are allowed to participate in multiple teams, bypassing the one-track-per-team rule. But honestly once I saw that the submission is just a pull request, I felt like Lambda wasn't going to pay much attention to our submission and lost hope (weak). Since I started this team focusing on the green agent submission, I decided to put my focus in that submission since it requires a presentation video. I have to start working on that tonight btw 😬

woah what model did you use for this haha
I see the 20/20/20/40 weight is interesting. I changed the score weights to 25/25/25/25/ recently so that LLM-as-a-judge doesn't take as much weight in the final score (that's what the logic weight is). Still trying to piece together how the red penalty ties in
aeduee — 4:24 PM
its green agent bro
i just tweaked the http request to parse my custom task which was to build a pow blockchain project
you can also see that it built multiple py files that the red agent exploits and green agent judges
aeduee — 4:29 PM
we use red agent to attack purples code
that returns vulnerabilities in the code and each vulnerability has a severity multiplier so if its easy to break the code the penality multiplier will be higher
then we take the max severity found and apply it as multiplier to final cis score
so beside the main raw score we also have red agent results that we also use to tank the score proportionally
the reason i put 40% for logic alone is that rationale scores are just vector similarity and logic review is the only component that actually checks correctness
josh

 — 4:35 PM
no like what llm, did you use qwen2.5? are you in a lambda instance or running a tiny llm? did you api?
josh

 — 4:37 PM
from my understanding, the logic score is calculated using an llm-as-a-judge; an llm is given a prompt and asked to evaluate the code from a qualitative perspective instead of using math to quantify anything. i added the logic score not too long ago because i wanted the green agent to have an llm aspect as well as the contextual integrity score which only uses math / vector 
josh

 — 4:37 PM
I gotcha
aeduee — 4:43 PM
qwen 2.5 32b
i think its defaulkt for all agents in the arena
josh

 — 4:49 PM
yep ok perfect
yeah rn im running a series of tests to compare scoring using the default against gtp-oss-20b as well as mistral and a few other agents; the goal is to see if the cis metric in the arena is noticeably higher or lower depending on what llm is loaded in
aeduee — 4:53 PM
its prolly gonna be different everytime since they can get creative
u might want to set like a seed to make sure ur getting the same result from each model everytime
also do we want more tasks in our tasklist
like i think we should add tasks with more complex architecture like building a snake game or blockchain just so we test that as well
josh

 — 5:07 PM
fair, if I'm testing the Logic evaluation using different llms i should use the same input for control
when you mean seed is that what you meant? i've never heard that term before
josh

 — 5:08 PM
definitely, after i finish these rounds i'll give you the results and make sure its easy to add and run new testing sets once tasks are added
aeduee — 5:19 PM
no i mean when ur prompting an llm with the same code you should get same response each run
its the way rng work kinda
josh

 — 5:19 PM
oh gotcha, well there will always be some variance, but yeah i should use the same input 
aeduee — 5:20 PM
bc random is not really random, its just math
so when u set a seed its gonna have the same random point each time so same random response yk
josh

 — 5:21 PM
i'm kinda getting it, yeah. even if the words it uses are different, it should communicate roughly the same response
aeduee — 5:21 PM
ig it would be better for submission (reproducibility wins for judges), but we can note in our video/docs that we could do like multi-sample averaging for production use
idk
aeduee — 5:22 PM
yea kinda
so u said for red agent its just a pull request?
josh

 — 5:35 PM
yoooo
aeduee — 5:35 PM
like its actually insane
we lwky just built an agi rn
aeduee — 5:36 PM
do you want me to work on that then
on behalf of our team so we hjavew more chance to win
ill try to vibecode smth i still have credits for claude
josh

honestly if you want to, yes please prepare this since you're interested; i would greatly appreciate it and you can submit it when you feel ready

big if true 😭 that would be so cool

Are you saving all of these to a db cause I’d love to take a look at these tonight

i just realized we might be falling back when generating hidden tests
im tryting to look into it rn
josh

 — 6:37 PM
Thank you
aeduee — 6:38 PM
bro i just found a crazy bug
apparently we never used qwen for the green agent so it was falling back on tests every time
josh

 — 6:50 PM
What 🥺
aeduee — 6:51 PM
bro we never had hidden tests i think 😭
josh

 — 6:51 PM
So the logic element is failing? Are you testing out of dev-sz01? I will investigate when I drive home
aeduee — 6:51 PM
i fixed it so well see how the run goes now
josh

 — 6:52 PM
Ok hmm let me know where the source of the problem was in the code
aeduee — 6:52 PM
its not failing there is apparently a naming conflict when we run teh arena
even tho both openai and qwen vars points to the same url, test generator itself expecvts qwen_url
but we are only supplying openai_url through docker build
someone messed up on the naming bruh
josh

 — 6:55 PM
I think I fixed this already in my branch but will verify to make sure
It must have been me though whoops
aeduee — 7:07 PM
when are u gonna merge

As soon as i get home, 20 minutes
