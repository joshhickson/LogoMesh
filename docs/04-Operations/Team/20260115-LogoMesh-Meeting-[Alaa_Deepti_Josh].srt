1
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,458
<b>Hmm we don't</b>

2
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:06,666
<b>So yeah, she had that yesterday and</b>

3
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:08,875
<b>hopefully she's gonna start feeling better</b>

4
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:13,583
<b>Yeah called her a few minutes ago, but she didn't answer so</b>

5
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:16,166
<b>I'm hoping she's just sleeping or something</b>

6
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:20,875
<b>But yeah, I got I got a check-in with her pretty soon</b>

7
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:22,500
<b>Yeah</b>

8
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,458
<b>Brition you're the best</b>

9
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,500
<b>Oh, yeah</b>

10
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,041
<b>since you're looking up now that she's</b>

11
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:30,791
<b>been approved for the infusions because</b>

12
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:35,291
<b>She's been waiting for months for that and it it took like</b>

13
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:38,833
<b>I don't know it just took a long time to get things going</b>

14
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:39,250
<b>so</b>

15
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:40,291
<b>you</b>

16
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:43,458
<b>at that point</b>

17
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:47,291
<b>Awesome. Yeah, yeah</b>

18
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:50,875
<b>Yeah, and then like as for the</b>

19
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:54,833
<b>this for the whole logo mesh thing I finally managed to</b>

20
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:59,166
<b>Test some battles. I wrote some scripts</b>

21
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:01,833
<b>Yeah, like ransom battles with</b>

22
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:04,583
<b>different large language models</b>

23
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:08,541
<b>Because yeah, I was like I was looking at the the draft</b>

24
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,875
<b>Research paper that's written up</b>

25
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,500
<b>and I'm like, well, we need to provide</b>

26
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:15,208
<b>like evidence that</b>

27
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:19,791
<b>What we've built is like quantifiable proof that</b>

28
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:24,250
<b>That the theories in the paper may have potential</b>

29
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,541
<b>So what I did was like I used a</b>

30
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:32,125
<b>tiny model. I think I used a mistral</b>

31
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:36,125
<b>Language model and then I yeah, I</b>

32
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,583
<b>ran it with like three scenarios</b>

33
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,500
<b>45 times oh here</b>

34
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:51,000
<b>Hello</b>

35
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:56,416
<b>Happy new year to you. I laugh within me a new year. Yeah</b>

36
01:01:57,416 --> 01:02:01,250
<b>Sorry for joining late. I am my camera on</b>

37
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,166
<b>the computer, but somehow I moved it somewhere</b>

38
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:05,916
<b>So I had to join in two places</b>

39
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:08,375
<b>on the screen and on the phone</b>

40
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:12,083
<b>So I'm here on both</b>

41
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:13,875
<b>Awesome</b>

42
01:02:19,791 --> 01:02:20,375
<b>Thank you</b>

43
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,458
<b>Yeah, yeah</b>

44
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:32,875
<b>Thank you for arranging this meeting really appreciate</b>

45
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:35,750
<b>thank you for waiting for me as well</b>

46
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:42,625
<b>I was kind of just I just started</b>

47
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:47,500
<b>Talking about you know, let me share my screen here. Oh,</b>

48
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,125
<b>yes. And also could you send me the link for the paper?</b>

49
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:56,875
<b>You know</b>

50
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:16,333
<b>Okay</b>

51
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:20,916
<b>Okay, so</b>

52
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,041
<b>Yeah, let's go here</b>

53
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:30,541
<b>Okay, so let me get you that link</b>

54
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,875
<b>Okay, I'll just I'll put it in the</b>

55
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,500
<b>Google meet chat and then I'll send it to</b>

56
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:43,875
<b>You on discord</b>

57
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:55,000
<b>I'm remoting into my PC here. Hold on. Hold on</b>

58
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:58,333
<b>Maybe I can find if it's in the repository. Um</b>

59
01:03:58,916 --> 01:03:59,208
<b>so</b>

60
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:03,458
<b>Yeah, I mean if you just go to the github website and you</b>

61
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:05,416
<b>go to the logo mesh repository</b>

62
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:09,208
<b>If you just type in the search bar</b>

63
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,208
<b>2025</b>

64
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,458
<b>Which is</b>

65
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:19,666
<b>November 18th, 2025. That's that's when I dated the paper</b>

66
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,541
<b>Then you'll find it you'll find the most recent draft</b>

67
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,666
<b>Agent text submission paper</b>

68
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:31,208
<b>Yeah, no, it's I think it's I think it's contextual debt</b>

69
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:34,833
<b>paper copyright edition or some silly name like that</b>

70
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:38,125
<b>I didn't I didn't have the naming conventions</b>

71
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,166
<b>Down very well</b>

72
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:44,208
<b>2025 11</b>

73
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,458
<b>With a</b>

74
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,041
<b>one</b>

75
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:51,166
<b>Here it is and then I have the link here. So</b>

76
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:53,083
<b>Okay, awesome</b>

77
01:04:53,083 --> 01:05:00,166
<b>Yep, got it</b>

78
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:07,875
<b>And then i'll try and find on google drive really quick</b>

79
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:14,833
<b>Oh</b>

80
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:16,166
<b>I don't actually think it</b>

81
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:22,541
<b>Oh, you know what this one's this</b>

82
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,958
<b>one's an outdated version of the papers so</b>

83
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:28,041
<b>Yeah, okay</b>

84
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:30,291
<b>Yeah, the the one that I have in</b>

85
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:32,500
<b>google drive doesn't include all of the math</b>

86
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:33,708
<b>Okay</b>

87
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:38,166
<b>Okay, here we go, okay</b>

88
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:39,000
<b>um</b>

89
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:41,541
<b>Yeah, so</b>

90
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:45,166
<b>Anyway, uh this version of the</b>

91
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:49,125
<b>paper includes um, I think it's</b>

92
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:51,125
<b>All the way down in</b>

93
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:57,791
<b>Yeah, it's called section three formalization the</b>

94
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,791
<b>contextual integrity score that's</b>

95
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:01,541
<b>where like the math is first introduced</b>

96
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:04,166
<b>And</b>

97
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,500
<b>There's kind of like</b>

98
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:12,375
<b>I don't know. There's kind of a suggested loop</b>

99
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:17,416
<b>Um, which I i'm 99 sure is what</b>

100
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:19,750
<b>i've translated into the actual arena</b>

101
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:21,500
<b>Which is good</b>

102
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:27,791
<b>And uh, and then basically like what i'm going to do is</b>

103
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:30,958
<b>like update the paper and include the results</b>

104
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:33,666
<b>of some tests by</b>

105
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:36,041
<b>kind of visualizing</b>

106
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:41,583
<b>A few database files</b>

107
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,791
<b>I have to I just realized</b>

108
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:46,750
<b>um</b>

109
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:49,500
<b>I just realized I accidentally</b>

110
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,083
<b>weighted the scores differently in one of the</b>

111
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,333
<b>One of the logs</b>

112
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:57,708
<b>So we'll have to manually</b>

113
01:06:58,291 --> 01:06:59,666
<b>weight the score again, which</b>

114
01:06:59,666 --> 01:07:01,250
<b>shouldn't be hard because it's</b>

115
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,250
<b>Like all of all the information</b>

116
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,958
<b>exists to do that so I can fix that</b>

117
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:08,458
<b>um, but I was kind of hoping for</b>

118
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:12,958
<b>Your guys is helping like visualizing the data that we did</b>

119
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,083
<b>collect because what I did do</b>

120
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:16,291
<b>was I ran</b>

121
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,125
<b>25 battles</b>

122
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:23,625
<b>in an in the agent arena with uh three scenarios</b>

123
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,500
<b>And I did that</b>

124
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:29,500
<b>Three times free per agent. I need to tell</b>

125
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,041
<b>my dog to be quiet. Hold on. I gotta mute</b>

126
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,791
<b>so you try different combinations</b>

127
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:38,500
<b>of agents for different tasks like or</b>

128
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:42,500
<b>Yeah, so</b>

129
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:49,083
<b>Hold on I'll I'll get you the file path for</b>

130
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:53,416
<b>the scenarios. I think it's just right here</b>

131
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:56,291
<b>Okay, judge no</b>

132
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,166
<b>Um</b>

133
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:04,916
<b>Hold on hold on these are for the red agent</b>

134
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,791
<b>Um</b>

135
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:12,375
<b>Yeah, look I need I need like 15 seconds</b>

136
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:25,500
<b>Yeah, what I have to do is</b>

137
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:27,291
<b>according to what we're talking</b>

138
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:28,500
<b>about in this meeting I have to</b>

139
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:31,791
<b>Create a briefing document at the same time. So I just</b>

140
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,291
<b>finished doing all this last night</b>

141
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:35,125
<b>um</b>

142
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:40,458
<b>But from what I understand one of the scenarios is an email</b>

143
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:44,125
<b>validator. So it prompts the purple agent to</b>

144
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:46,083
<b>Um</b>

145
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:48,208
<b>Create</b>

146
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,333
<b>an email validation system</b>

147
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:53,083
<b>and</b>

148
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:56,333
<b>it does so in a way that asks for</b>

149
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:00,666
<b>Specific aspects of the code so that it can</b>

150
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:03,625
<b>evaluate those things with the cis metric</b>

151
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:06,875
<b>And what the green agent does is like after it prompts the</b>

152
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:08,791
<b>purple agent it waits for the output</b>

153
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:12,583
<b>And the output is delivered within a json string</b>

154
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:15,583
<b>And then what it does is</b>

155
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:19,583
<b>The green agent has four metrics. It has the three</b>

156
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:21,416
<b>contextual integrity score pillars</b>

157
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,125
<b>But then the fourth one is actually just</b>

158
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,958
<b>A simple llm as a judge. So whatever</b>

159
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,250
<b>whatever model is loaded into the arena</b>

160
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,375
<b>Like if mistral is loaded into the arena it will</b>

161
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:38,166
<b>Uh be used for the green agent. It'll be used for the</b>

162
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:41,208
<b>purple agent and if the red agent is turned on</b>

163
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,000
<b>Which it was not for these tests</b>

164
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,791
<b>because these tests were just for</b>

165
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,833
<b>the the contextual integrity score proof</b>

166
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:53,583
<b>Then yeah, so the green so the the fourth</b>

167
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:57,250
<b>metric is logic but let me see if I can find</b>

168
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,666
<b>So essentially, um</b>

169
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:06,833
<b>You ran how many models you said</b>

170
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:08,416
<b>just three</b>

171
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:12,125
<b>three models and three scenarios, so</b>

172
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,166
<b>I I was just wondering how we ended up with um</b>

173
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:18,208
<b>How many you said 20?</b>

174
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:19,916
<b>I don't know 40</b>

175
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:20,916
<b>right</b>

176
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,666
<b>20 25</b>

177
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,791
<b>25 battles. Yeah</b>

178
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,708
<b>battles per model just as an initial run</b>

179
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:30,291
<b>Uh-huh. So you're you're</b>

180
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:33,541
<b>re-running them with the same scenarios</b>

181
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:36,916
<b>Yeah, and I decided uh, I</b>

182
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:38,916
<b>decided to pick the scenarios at random</b>

183
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:40,000
<b>no</b>

184
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:42,375
<b>I</b>

185
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:46,000
<b>Just I don't know if that's that was I don't know if that</b>

186
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,708
<b>was the correct thing to do. So</b>

187
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:50,625
<b>Um, if possible, I can rerun</b>

188
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:53,625
<b>scenarios today if we don't want</b>

189
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,750
<b>If we don't want that but I just</b>

190
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,541
<b>selected that initially because</b>

191
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:01,958
<b>Um, I just didn't put enough thought into</b>

192
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:05,416
<b>Like whether or not I should do</b>

193
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,083
<b>You know like a rounds</b>

194
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:11,125
<b>a number of rounds that's divisible by three like I could</b>

195
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:13,666
<b>have done 30 rounds per agent and then just</b>

196
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:17,958
<b>done, you know 10 rounds of each scenario, but</b>

197
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:21,125
<b>I don't know. I was just I was just</b>

198
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,458
<b>trying to get things done yesterday</b>

199
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,125
<b>So I just went with whatever my</b>

200
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:26,625
<b>coding agent suggested and it was like okay</b>

201
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:29,416
<b>We'll just just select the rounds randomly and then do 25</b>

202
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:31,000
<b>each and I was like, okay,</b>

203
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,583
<b>whatever. We'll just go with that</b>

204
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:35,916
<b>um, but it should roughly amount to</b>

205
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:39,333
<b>We should still have enough</b>

206
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:41,208
<b>data that we need to visualize uh</b>

207
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:42,333
<b>the results</b>

208
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:46,166
<b>It takes it takes a a few hours to rerun everything</b>

209
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:48,375
<b>with the larger models</b>

210
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:50,625
<b>so I could do</b>

211
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,791
<b>I could rerun it today if you guys want but</b>

212
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:57,208
<b>My main concern is just basically</b>

213
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,666
<b>getting you guys the information</b>

214
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:00,041
<b>um</b>

215
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:03,041
<b>With dt. I was kind of like hoping</b>

216
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:06,375
<b>Uh, so the the round information the</b>

217
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:08,666
<b>results of the rounds, uh, everything was stored</b>

218
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,166
<b>in a uh, sqlite</b>

219
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,458
<b>Database, so I have okay. I have three separate databases</b>

220
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,166
<b>Mm-hmm, and i'll be</b>

221
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:22,333
<b>When I give you guys the briefing document from today's</b>

222
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:24,083
<b>meeting i'll make sure that the file paths are</b>

223
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:26,291
<b>um in this meeting</b>

224
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,250
<b>Okay, uh as for</b>

225
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:34,875
<b>The three scenarios, uh, they're all defined</b>

226
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:39,041
<b>Oh email the validator was skipped</b>

227
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:40,958
<b>Okay</b>

228
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,500
<b>Yeah, I might I might be running</b>

229
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,333
<b>some extra battles today. We'll see</b>

230
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,208
<b>but everything's defined in</b>

231
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,583
<b>Source screen logic tasks.py.</b>

232
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:52,750
<b>Let's take a look at that really quick</b>

233
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:57,250
<b>Going there source screen green logic. Yep</b>

234
01:12:58,666 --> 01:12:59,458
<b>And then</b>

235
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:02,041
<b>Should be tasks.py</b>

236
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:06,125
<b>Task.py just okay. Yeah, so we</b>

237
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,333
<b>skipped over the email validator task</b>

238
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,416
<b>um because</b>

239
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:12,250
<b>I was running into</b>

240
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:15,000
<b>some dns lookup errors</b>

241
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:19,791
<b>because when the agent was being prompted to</b>

242
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:24,458
<b>Create the email validation function it was like</b>

243
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:27,166
<b>assuming that it was going to have access to the internet,</b>

244
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:29,375
<b>so I just I kept running into</b>

245
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:32,500
<b>To some network denialers. So I</b>

246
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,291
<b>I tried to fix it and then I just excluded</b>

247
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:37,250
<b>it because it was taking up too much time</b>

248
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:39,750
<b>So the first task was excluded</b>

249
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,291
<b>I used the rate limiter task</b>

250
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:44,958
<b>the lru cache task</b>

251
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:49,916
<b>And the recursive fibonacci task</b>

252
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:51,541
<b>Um</b>

253
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,041
<b>One malvalidator rate limiter</b>

254
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:01,166
<b>Recursively bonacci</b>

255
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:05,500
<b>Yeah, while you guys look that over I</b>

256
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,875
<b>gotta I gotta let my dogs out really quick</b>

257
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:10,125
<b>Yeah</b>

258
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:13,500
<b>Oh</b>

259
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,125
<b>And then um</b>

260
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:47,875
<b>I also have a different teammate who's been running some</b>

261
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,833
<b>tasks with a red agent turned</b>

262
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:51,250
<b>on.</b>

263
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:53,583
<b>So he's been like putting in custom scenarios.</b>

264
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:58,958
<b>And he shared a database file with me earlier today.</b>

265
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:02,833
<b>I haven't looked over this, this file.</b>

266
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:09,750
<b>I'll put it inside the repository and</b>

267
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:14,458
<b>just give it a label that it's his database.</b>

268
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:18,291
<b>So this is a Python file.</b>

269
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:21,625
<b>Josh.</b>

270
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:22,791
<b>Yeah.</b>

271
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:26,666
<b>Looks a description.</b>

272
01:15:29,666 --> 01:15:34,000
<b>So where is the database file?</b>

273
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:38,000
<b>Is this being used to create a database of all the tasks?</b>

274
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:39,666
<b>Is how I understand.</b>

275
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:46,625
<b>It's complicated, but where you can</b>

276
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:50,291
<b>find the database is in, let me see.</b>

277
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:53,000
<b>Hold on.</b>

278
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:53,750
<b>Hold on.</b>

279
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:55,791
<b>I got to get to the right branch here.</b>

280
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,000
<b>My teammate wanted all the databases deleted from master,</b>

281
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,333
<b>but they're still existing in</b>

282
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:02,875
<b>my working branch here.</b>

283
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:04,875
<b>I think it's in the data folder.</b>

284
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:06,750
<b>Here we go.</b>

285
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:07,083
<b>Okay.</b>

286
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:07,541
<b>Yeah.</b>

287
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,458
<b>Let me show you this specific link so</b>

288
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,041
<b>that you guys will be in the right branch.</b>

289
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:14,333
<b>Thank you.</b>

290
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:16,875
<b>My most recent changes were pushed</b>

291
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:19,208
<b>to this branch early this morning.</b>

292
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:23,708
<b>In data.</b>

293
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:24,750
<b>Okay, great.</b>

294
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:25,625
<b>Yeah.</b>

295
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:26,541
<b>Okay.</b>

296
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:27,791
<b>I'm seeing a database.</b>

297
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:30,875
<b>What kind of database is this?</b>

298
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:31,916
<b>Is it a?</b>

299
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:37,000
<b>I think it should be SQLite.</b>

300
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:39,541
<b>SQLite, yes.</b>

301
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:40,083
<b>Okay.</b>

302
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:41,375
<b>Let me verify that.</b>

303
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:45,458
<b>I mean, that's been the goal.</b>

304
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:49,125
<b>So hopefully it stayed that, but I don't know.</b>

305
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:50,250
<b>I've been doing a lot of work.</b>

306
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:55,500
<b>Okay.</b>

307
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,375
<b>So all the tasks are in the database or</b>

308
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:08,958
<b>are all the results from the agents logged in</b>

309
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:09,541
<b>the databases.</b>

310
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:11,958
<b>There are a few databases here.</b>

311
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:14,541
<b>So the database, the databases</b>

312
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:17,875
<b>contain logs from Browns that were run.</b>

313
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:19,750
<b>So.</b>

314
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:21,166
<b>Okay.</b>

315
01:17:22,291 --> 01:17:22,375
<b>Okay.</b>

316
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,500
<b>So it should hopefully contain information</b>

317
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:30,500
<b>about each task that was run, how the task</b>

318
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,708
<b>was validated, the results of each scoring, and then the</b>

319
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:37,583
<b>weights of the scoring and then</b>

320
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:39,125
<b>the final combined score.</b>

321
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:40,250
<b>Right.</b>

322
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:40,708
<b>Okay.</b>

323
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:43,583
<b>Because the green agent, it rates</b>

324
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,791
<b>it using four different metrics.</b>

325
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,666
<b>There's three quantifiable ones,</b>

326
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:49,458
<b>the contextual integrity score.</b>

327
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:53,916
<b>So architectural testing and rationale.</b>

328
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:57,500
<b>A good acronym to remember is RAT.</b>

329
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,416
<b>So R for rationale, A for</b>

330
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:02,958
<b>architectural, and T for testing, RAT.</b>

331
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:08,250
<b>So the RAT scores, those are all quantifiable.</b>

332
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,208
<b>And then the logic score is ironically</b>

333
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:15,375
<b>an agent as a judge, an LLM as a judge.</b>

334
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:18,083
<b>So that score is finally</b>

335
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:23,458
<b>whatever LLM is loaded into the arena.</b>

336
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:27,166
<b>It's prompted to review the</b>

337
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:29,833
<b>outputted code and provide a score.</b>

338
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:32,458
<b>Is that the green agent?</b>

339
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:33,500
<b>Yeah.</b>

340
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:34,416
<b>Yeah.</b>

341
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:35,125
<b>That's the green agent.</b>

342
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:35,666
<b>Yeah.</b>

343
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,666
<b>For these tests, I turned the red agent off.</b>

344
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,750
<b>Oh, because.</b>

345
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:47,041
<b>Because I just purely wanted to test</b>

346
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:51,041
<b>what we're trying to argue for in the paper.</b>

347
01:18:52,916 --> 01:18:55,083
<b>Right now, I haven't.</b>

348
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:56,375
<b>Okay.</b>

349
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:57,500
<b>Yeah.</b>

350
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:02,416
<b>Because we are only submitting today for the.</b>

351
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:09,166
<b>We need to not submit tomorrow.</b>

352
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,000
<b>Is that right?</b>

353
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:11,458
<b>Is that the reason?</b>

354
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:13,958
<b>Yeah.</b>

355
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:14,541
<b>Yeah.</b>

356
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:20,375
<b>But the thing is, if I can clean up, if I</b>

357
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:24,083
<b>can clean up the repository enough, I will</b>

358
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,875
<b>leave in the red agent as an option.</b>

359
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:28,583
<b>Okay.</b>

360
01:19:28,916 --> 01:19:32,833
<b>And I will be running more arena tests today.</b>

361
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:34,666
<b>Okay.</b>

362
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:38,458
<b>But yesterday, what I wanted to do is I just wanted to</b>

363
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:41,958
<b>create a really simple set of test</b>

364
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,583
<b>results.</b>

365
01:19:43,666 --> 01:19:43,958
<b>Right.</b>

366
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,666
<b>For us to analyze that, just focus on the contextual</b>

367
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:52,375
<b>integrity score and just keep the</b>

368
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:54,333
<b>red agent turned off so that we can</b>

369
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:56,833
<b>kind of just stay focused on the paper.</b>

370
01:19:56,833 --> 01:20:01,250
<b>Because it's like, we need proof that what</b>

371
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:03,416
<b>we're arguing for in the paper has value.</b>

372
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:08,916
<b>And I'm hoping that these sets of</b>

373
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:13,166
<b>battles will provide that proof.</b>

374
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:18,875
<b>So let me start creating that briefing</b>

375
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:21,041
<b>document that will provide the file paths.</b>

376
01:20:21,041 --> 01:20:23,541
<b>Because there's a lot of database files in that folder.</b>

377
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:26,333
<b>And you'll need the three correct ones.</b>

378
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:30,250
<b>And then one of them has the scores weighted differently.</b>

379
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,583
<b>And we'll have to disclose that</b>

380
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:33,416
<b>in the briefing document for today.</b>

381
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:38,625
<b>Okay.</b>

382
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:48,708
<b>So, yeah, basically what should be proven here in this</b>

383
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:52,375
<b>theory is like, even though the</b>

384
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:56,541
<b>green agent is run by an LLM, is</b>

385
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:58,750
<b>the same LLM as the purple agent.</b>

386
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:03,833
<b>Like let's say, you know, like, like</b>

387
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:08,833
<b>Mistral, a really tiny agent versus Quinn, a larger</b>

388
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:12,083
<b>agent and then GPT OSS 20B.</b>

389
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:18,500
<b>Theoretically, the contextual integrity scores should be</b>

390
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,000
<b>higher, the better the agent is</b>

391
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:25,000
<b>at coding, even if the agent is grading itself.</b>

392
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,250
<b>And then there, you know, it can get deeper than that.</b>

393
01:22:32,291 --> 01:22:34,416
<b>There's, there's more things I was trying to prove, but</b>

394
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,041
<b>like, that's, that's basically</b>

395
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:39,541
<b>like the simplest conclusion</b>

396
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:42,000
<b>that I wanted to draw from that.</b>

397
01:22:44,583 --> 01:22:46,125
<b>I'll be honest, I spent a lot of time</b>

398
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:50,375
<b>setting this up and debugging the past 48 hours.</b>

399
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:55,583
<b>So I'm kind of, yeah, I'm kind of scatterbrained right now.</b>

400
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:59,875
<b>So it would, it would kind of help if you guys have like</b>

401
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:04,333
<b>any other questions, but because</b>

402
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:10,500
<b>like I'll have to spend, I'll have to spend time providing</b>

403
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,916
<b>the answers to these questions</b>

404
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:12,458
<b>today.</b>

405
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:14,000
<b>No problems.</b>

406
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:14,958
<b>Yeah.</b>

407
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:18,875
<b>So I won't ask many questions.</b>

408
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:23,291
<b>My main questions are, so are you submitting this whole</b>

409
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:27,458
<b>repo in the competition today,</b>

410
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:32,291
<b>or just the green agent part of the repo?</b>

411
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:39,750
<b>And then the second is, are we, I think you said we were</b>

412
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,333
<b>supposed to record a video or</b>

413
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:41,666
<b>something.</b>

414
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:49,583
<b>Oh, because it is due today at 12 o'clock PST.</b>

415
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:51,416
<b>Oh boy.</b>

416
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:55,125
<b>So instead of being, let me see.</b>

417
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,708
<b>Oh, great.</b>

418
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:04,166
<b>Oh, instead of the 16th, it's the 15th.</b>

419
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:04,583
<b>Okay.</b>

420
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:06,208
<b>That's, that's fine.</b>

421
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:06,833
<b>Yeah.</b>

422
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:13,791
<b>I will have to produce the video today.</b>

423
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:15,708
<b>I thought we had an extra day.</b>

424
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:19,875
<b>No, we today and you know what will happen?</b>

425
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:22,750
<b>Josh is many people will try to submit at</b>

426
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:26,750
<b>the last minute and the network will, I'm</b>

427
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,000
<b>sure there are a lot of people.</b>

428
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:35,333
<b>So and then the third question is, so we, so you will</b>

429
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:36,916
<b>create the video because you have</b>

430
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:42,375
<b>an expertise in all that work of camera and everything.</b>

431
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:44,500
<b>Yeah.</b>

432
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:47,208
<b>And I don't think I'm going to show my face in the video.</b>

433
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:53,708
<b>I think I'm, what I'm basically going to do is create a</b>

434
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:56,625
<b>PowerPoint slide that, you know,</b>

435
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:58,291
<b>shows some good visualizations.</b>

436
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,750
<b>I'll probably show some code snippets.</b>

437
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,208
<b>Right.</b>

438
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:07,500
<b>And then hopefully if you're able to visualize the results</b>

439
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:12,041
<b>of the tests that I ran yesterday,</b>

440
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:15,125
<b>I'll show some visualizations of that.</b>

441
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:17,500
<b>And then we can also include that in the paper.</b>

442
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:23,000
<b>And then, and then we'll just have to submit what we have.</b>

443
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:28,500
<b>So okay.</b>

444
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:32,208
<b>I thought we were going to have an extra 24 hours here.</b>

445
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:35,250
<b>So where this, this is going to be, we're going to be</b>

446
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,833
<b>cutting it close today, for sure.</b>

447
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:38,666
<b>Right.</b>

448
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:40,458
<b>And then that is fine.</b>

449
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:41,708
<b>I think you have done all the</b>

450
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:43,750
<b>work on arranging it together.</b>

451
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:47,750
<b>So now, so we are only submitting for the green agent.</b>

452
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:52,875
<b>You would be able to create the video without your picture</b>

453
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:54,625
<b>and then include a house, whoever</b>

454
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:55,166
<b>you want.</b>

455
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:56,833
<b>If you want any help, let me know.</b>

456
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,708
<b>And then the third question is, since we are only</b>

457
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:01,750
<b>submitting for the green agent, when</b>

458
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,833
<b>was the, when is the due date for the lambda track?</b>

459
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:07,500
<b>I forgot, but we can check.</b>

460
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:12,166
<b>From what I understand, it says the 16th in that.</b>

461
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:13,750
<b>Okay.</b>

462
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,416
<b>But lambda.</b>

463
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:18,250
<b>Yeah, I'm second guessing myself now</b>

464
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:20,791
<b>because I thought it was the 16th for.</b>

465
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:22,416
<b>No, it is.</b>

466
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:24,875
<b>They keep sending emails.</b>

467
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:30,291
<b>It is today and then it is today at 12 p.m.</b>

468
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:31,791
<b>At 12 o'clock midnight.</b>

469
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:32,708
<b>Okay.</b>

470
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:34,958
<b>Okay.</b>

471
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:43,416
<b>Well, lambdas document says November 24th to January 16th.</b>

472
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:47,000
<b>So that could mean, I mean, they</b>

473
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,041
<b>don't provide a, what time zone.</b>

474
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:51,291
<b>I'm going to assume it's the same</b>

475
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:56,083
<b>exact time as our competition here.</b>

476
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:58,583
<b>It says, I didn't share with you.</b>

477
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:02,083
<b>It says, remember that agent beats</b>

478
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:04,583
<b>phase one submission deadline is tomorrow.</b>

479
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:07,083
<b>It I received it yesterday.</b>

480
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:08,875
<b>Make sure to submit your</b>

481
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:11,958
<b>projects by January 15th, 11.59 p.m.</b>

482
01:27:12,458 --> 01:27:12,916
<b>Pacific time.</b>

483
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:14,500
<b>Okay.</b>

484
01:27:17,041 --> 01:27:20,125
<b>So now my third question is.</b>

485
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:24,083
<b>What I opened here.</b>

486
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:24,625
<b>Yeah.</b>

487
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:27,500
<b>Now the diagram that we produced</b>

488
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:31,625
<b>and then you updated it to meet.</b>

489
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:32,291
<b>Yeah.</b>

490
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,208
<b>Is I put it here.</b>

491
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,500
<b>This diagram, this shows lambda</b>

492
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,750
<b>track and also the custom track.</b>

493
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,541
<b>I shared it in the meeting.</b>

494
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,458
<b>Comment messages here.</b>

495
01:27:52,916 --> 01:27:53,625
<b>Let me take a look.</b>

496
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:55,041
<b>Yeah.</b>

497
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:04,041
<b>So now how will this document apply to what we are</b>

498
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:05,500
<b>submitting if you're only submitting</b>

499
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,250
<b>the green agent.</b>

500
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:10,166
<b>Do you want me to produce one just for the green agent?</b>

501
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,625
<b>That would be awesome if you could.</b>

502
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:14,833
<b>Okay.</b>

503
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:15,833
<b>Yeah.</b>

504
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:16,458
<b>Okay.</b>

505
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,416
<b>Then updated this.</b>

506
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,375
<b>Do we have a copy a document for</b>

507
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,958
<b>the green agent now in the docs?</b>

508
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:30,041
<b>You mean like a high level overview of the current</b>

509
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:32,208
<b>functionality of the green agent?</b>

510
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:33,500
<b>Yeah.</b>

511
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:36,291
<b>Because now we are only submitting the green agent, right?</b>

512
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:42,458
<b>Submitting the lambda track right now.</b>

513
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:46,416
<b>This is tough for me to answer because technically my</b>

514
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:50,750
<b>teammate did a lot of work on using the</b>

515
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:54,416
<b>red agent and kind of incorporating it into the green agent</b>

516
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:56,375
<b>and he's running pretty successful</b>

517
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:56,875
<b>tests.</b>

518
01:28:57,458 --> 01:29:01,791
<b>The test that I ran yesterday, I had that turned off</b>

519
01:29:01,791 --> 01:29:03,083
<b>because he was working on it.</b>

520
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:06,333
<b>So it's tough because it would be valuable if we...</b>

521
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:08,166
<b>You know what?</b>

522
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:12,541
<b>I would just say for this track, for the custom green agent</b>

523
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:14,583
<b>track, let's just submit it without</b>

524
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:15,250
<b>the red agent.</b>

525
01:29:16,541 --> 01:29:18,416
<b>What I'll do is I'll create a branch</b>

526
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:23,958
<b>in the repository where it's removed.</b>

527
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:29,500
<b>And I'll clean up the documentation so that only essential</b>

528
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,750
<b>documents exist and make sure</b>

529
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:37,666
<b>that there's no junk files because there's a few.</b>

530
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:40,875
<b>And then...</b>

531
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:41,458
<b>Okay.</b>

532
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:46,708
<b>Yeah.</b>

533
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:47,708
<b>And then once that finishes,</b>

534
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:53,916
<b>you know, we'll see how it goes.</b>

535
01:29:53,958 --> 01:29:57,916
<b>But yeah, I'm planning on only submitting the green agent.</b>

536
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,166
<b>I mean, I kept it turned off, but</b>

537
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:03,291
<b>I kept the red agent turned off.</b>

538
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,833
<b>And the purple agent?</b>

539
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:12,333
<b>The purple agent?</b>

540
01:30:12,333 --> 01:30:13,041
<b>Yeah, of course.</b>

541
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:14,500
<b>Of course I'll be including that because</b>

542
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:17,125
<b>that's required as part of the submission.</b>

543
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:19,791
<b>Yes.</b>

544
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:22,750
<b>Okay. And I'll provide documentation</b>

545
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,500
<b>for how that functions as well.</b>

546
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:27,625
<b>But yeah.</b>

547
01:30:28,958 --> 01:30:30,583
<b>Oh man, this is a lot.</b>

548
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:32,291
<b>Okay.</b>

549
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,541
<b>So lambda drag what red agent submission?</b>

550
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,833
<b>I'm checking the red line.</b>

551
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:47,333
<b>Red agent.</b>

552
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:53,125
<b>Green agent.</b>

553
01:30:53,458 --> 01:30:54,583
<b>Tomorrow is a judging.</b>

554
01:30:56,291 --> 01:30:56,500
<b>Okay.</b>

555
01:30:57,583 --> 01:31:01,000
<b>And then purple agent is February 2.</b>

556
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:04,250
<b>Phase 1 is just the green agent.</b>

557
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,916
<b>The purple agent is February 2.</b>

558
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:08,291
<b>And then the red agent.</b>

559
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:13,500
<b>It's yet to be announced.</b>

560
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:17,791
<b>Lambda drag, right?</b>

561
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:25,541
<b>Yeah, it's yet to be announced because they will be for</b>

562
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:26,666
<b>phase 2, they'll be selecting</b>

563
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:29,041
<b>the green agents from phase 1.</b>

564
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:29,916
<b>Okay.</b>

565
01:31:30,041 --> 01:31:35,041
<b>So okay, then I think we got a bit of work to do.</b>

566
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:38,166
<b>If you can pull a branch with only the red agent related to</b>

567
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:40,166
<b>green agent related information,</b>

568
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:40,583
<b>right?</b>

569
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,333
<b>And then let me know.</b>

570
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:45,791
<b>And then if there is a document just for the green agent,</b>

571
01:31:45,791 --> 01:31:48,166
<b>then I focus on building this</b>

572
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:51,208
<b>pictorial just for the green agent.</b>

573
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,458
<b>What do you think, Allah?</b>

574
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:53,625
<b>Is that good?</b>

575
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:58,083
<b>Yeah, I mean, it sounds like</b>

576
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:00,291
<b>you have things sorted outside.</b>

577
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:03,291
<b>I don't want to be disruptive, but if I</b>

578
01:32:03,291 --> 01:32:05,791
<b>can help speed anything up, let me know.</b>

579
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:06,791
<b>Okay.</b>

580
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:07,583
<b>Yeah.</b>

581
01:32:08,083 --> 01:32:08,541
<b>Yeah.</b>

582
01:32:09,166 --> 01:32:10,875
<b>No problem.</b>

583
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:13,666
<b>I may need help with publishing on archive.</b>

584
01:32:14,041 --> 01:32:15,083
<b>I've never done that before.</b>

585
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:18,458
<b>So I'll need to make sure that</b>

586
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:20,458
<b>I have the formatting correct.</b>

587
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:21,750
<b>Yeah.</b>

588
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:26,583
<b>If you could send me the complete paper,</b>

589
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:28,833
<b>then I'll have to turn into latex and then</b>

590
01:32:28,875 --> 01:32:32,166
<b>PDF, then we can put it here.</b>

591
01:32:32,541 --> 01:32:32,750
<b>Yeah.</b>

592
01:32:33,541 --> 01:32:36,250
<b>So is it okay if I just give you a plain markdown file?</b>

593
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:38,708
<b>Would that be possible?</b>

594
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:40,166
<b>Yeah.</b>

595
01:32:40,166 --> 01:32:40,416
<b>Yeah.</b>

596
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:40,625
<b>Yeah.</b>

597
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:41,166
<b>Okay.</b>

598
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:43,666
<b>I'll do the rest myself.</b>

599
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:45,958
<b>So okay.</b>

600
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:46,500
<b>Thank you.</b>

601
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:46,625
<b>Yeah.</b>

602
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:49,750
<b>If you can handle that, that would be absolutely perfect.</b>

603
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:51,041
<b>Mm hmm.</b>

604
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:55,833
<b>And then, um, yeah, deep tea.</b>

605
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:59,916
<b>I'm going to send you, I'm first going to send you the, the</b>

606
01:32:59,916 --> 01:33:01,958
<b>briefing document that provides</b>

607
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
<b>links to all of the database, the three database files that</b>

608
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,791
<b>you need and explains how the scoring</b>

609
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,083
<b>was weighted differently in one of them.</b>

610
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,458
<b>And I'll try and repair that.</b>

611
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:17,583
<b>If I can't repair that.</b>

612
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:23,666
<b>So you can just visualize like the individual pillars of</b>

613
01:33:23,666 --> 01:33:25,000
<b>the scoring instead of the final</b>

614
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,666
<b>weighted score.</b>

615
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:31,875
<b>Cause like two of the, two of the database documents were</b>

616
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:36,083
<b>created with a equal 25% weight</b>

617
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:38,916
<b>between all four parts of the score.</b>

618
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:43,125
<b>You know, the rat score 25% per each of that.</b>

619
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:45,291
<b>And then 25% for the logic score.</b>

620
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:50,083
<b>But one of them is 20, 20, 20, 40.</b>

621
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:53,250
<b>The logic score got a 40% weight.</b>

622
01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:55,833
<b>So I want to fix that.</b>

623
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:57,666
<b>I think the information, there's enough information in the</b>

624
01:33:57,666 --> 01:33:59,541
<b>database to fix that because it's just</b>

625
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:00,583
<b>a final score weight.</b>

626
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:04,833
<b>But if I, for some reason cannot do</b>

627
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:06,500
<b>that, we'll have to work around that.</b>

628
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:07,916
<b>Okay.</b>

629
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:08,833
<b>It should be pretty simple.</b>

630
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:12,875
<b>And then I can get you the information for</b>

631
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:22,791
<b>what exactly was done to like what battles</b>

632
01:34:22,791 --> 01:34:23,375
<b>were ran.</b>

633
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,958
<b>I can give you like names of specific</b>

634
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:30,500
<b>models if you want in the briefing document.</b>

635
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,791
<b>I will continue to update the briefing document too.</b>

636
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:37,875
<b>So in the same working branch.</b>

637
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:39,708
<b>Okay.</b>

638
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:42,375
<b>So once you update, then let me know and then I'll add the</b>

639
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:44,125
<b>pictorial there with the link</b>

640
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:45,708
<b>to the dogs, right?</b>

641
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:47,666
<b>Is that good?</b>

642
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:49,708
<b>Yeah.</b>

643
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:51,166
<b>Okay.</b>

644
01:34:51,250 --> 01:35:01,541
<b>And then by, I will be out from 6 30 to 9 Eastern time.</b>

645
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:05,833
<b>So I can do before that or after that.</b>

646
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:11,625
<b>If you are able to do it by three, which is by into a</b>

647
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:17,500
<b>before 330 your time, then I can</b>

648
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,208
<b>update before or I'll do afterwards.</b>

649
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:19,791
<b>That good.</b>

650
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:20,583
<b>Yeah.</b>

651
01:35:21,208 --> 01:35:22,291
<b>Let me know on Slack.</b>

652
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:22,958
<b>Okay.</b>

653
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:24,666
<b>Around 3pm Pacific time.</b>

654
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:27,291
<b>Yes.</b>

655
01:35:28,291 --> 01:35:30,500
<b>Before you will be cutting close because I</b>

656
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:33,666
<b>have to leave at 330 Pacific, but I'll be</b>

657
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:33,916
<b>back.</b>

658
01:35:34,583 --> 01:35:38,166
<b>I can do later today or I can, if you have time now,</b>

659
01:35:38,416 --> 01:35:39,875
<b>whichever way we can just play</b>

660
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:41,875
<b>by the discord messages, right?</b>

661
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:42,916
<b>I'll keep checking.</b>

662
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:43,541
<b>Yeah.</b>

663
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:44,583
<b>Okay.</b>

664
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:45,875
<b>Yeah, that works great.</b>

665
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:47,208
<b>Yeah.</b>

666
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:51,375
<b>And then the time to submit is 11 59pm.</b>

667
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:54,500
<b>So as I said, usually it becomes</b>

668
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,166
<b>very hard to submit towards the end.</b>

669
01:35:57,208 --> 01:36:01,916
<b>So let's target submitting by like 11pm</b>

670
01:36:01,916 --> 01:36:05,125
<b>PST and maybe have a dry run before that.</b>

671
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:07,500
<b>I don't know if you want to.</b>

672
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:10,291
<b>I'll aim for 10 so that we have an extra.</b>

673
01:36:10,916 --> 01:36:11,500
<b>Yeah.</b>

674
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:13,208
<b>I'll try and have everything in</b>

675
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:16,250
<b>order by 10pm, including the video.</b>

676
01:36:18,541 --> 01:36:20,666
<b>I'm probably not going to focus too much on the video.</b>

677
01:36:20,666 --> 01:36:23,916
<b>I'm probably just going to make sure that there's enough</b>

678
01:36:23,916 --> 01:36:25,750
<b>for them to be satisfied, but</b>

679
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:27,375
<b>I'm not going to go overboard since we</b>

680
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:29,875
<b>only have a few hours to complete it.</b>

681
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:30,666
<b>Yes.</b>

682
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:31,250
<b>Okay.</b>

683
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:32,500
<b>Thank you.</b>

684
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,208
<b>Yeah.</b>

685
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:34,083
<b>Right.</b>

686
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:35,250
<b>Okay.</b>

687
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:38,083
<b>Yeah.</b>

688
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:39,208
<b>I recorded this meeting.</b>

689
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:40,208
<b>I'm going to.</b>

690
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:42,750
<b>Yeah.</b>

691
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:46,208
<b>I'm going to save the transcript of this</b>

692
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:47,666
<b>meeting and then I'm going to use it to copy</b>

693
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,666
<b>the briefing document that</b>

694
01:36:48,666 --> 01:36:50,250
<b>contains all the information that we need.</b>

695
01:36:50,958 --> 01:36:52,333
<b>And that document will be ready</b>

696
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:54,291
<b>within like the next hour or so.</b>

697
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:55,333
<b>Okay.</b>

698
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:59,416
<b>I also shared the link for the Overleaf project where I'll</b>

699
01:36:59,416 --> 01:37:02,000
<b>be creating the Latex document.</b>

700
01:37:02,541 --> 01:37:06,416
<b>So in case you want to make any last minute changes after I</b>

701
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:08,083
<b>convert everything, then yeah,</b>

702
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:08,958
<b>you could do that.</b>

703
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:10,416
<b>Yeah.</b>

704
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:11,666
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

705
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:12,625
<b>No worries.</b>

706
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:15,625
<b>If you also want to hang on</b>

707
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:16,750
<b>the educator quickly, it's fine.</b>

708
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:17,416
<b>Yeah.</b>

709
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,083
<b>Oh, not register.</b>

710
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:19,833
<b>Oh, I have to register.</b>

711
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:23,541
<b>Let me see. Let me see.</b>

712
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,500
<b>And then I saw one of your messages,</b>

713
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:31,916
<b>Josh, about lambda track registration.</b>

714
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:33,000
<b>I don't know.</b>

715
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,333
<b>I couldn't find that message again on Slack.</b>

716
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:37,250
<b>Was it sent?</b>

717
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:39,708
<b>Usually it is a new message that box up.</b>

718
01:37:40,166 --> 01:37:40,750
<b>So it's in.</b>

719
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:43,791
<b>So let me show you here.</b>

720
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:46,083
<b>So Discord's kind of funny.</b>

721
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:48,625
<b>Where the direct messages are stored.</b>

722
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:52,250
<b>They're actually stored where this logo is in the top left.</b>

723
01:37:52,541 --> 01:37:54,041
<b>Can you see my screen that I'm sharing?</b>

724
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:55,791
<b>Yeah.</b>

725
01:37:56,375 --> 01:38:01,500
<b>So if you just click here and then you find my name here.</b>

726
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:03,458
<b>Oh, let me see.</b>

727
01:38:04,708 --> 01:38:05,458
<b>Direct messages.</b>

728
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:08,125
<b>Oh, oh yeah.</b>

729
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:09,125
<b>I found it now.</b>

730
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:09,875
<b>Why couldn't find it?</b>

731
01:38:09,916 --> 01:38:12,500
<b>Well, it's okay.</b>

732
01:38:13,666 --> 01:38:20,666
<b>Because if you didn't sign up the team.</b>

733
01:38:21,083 --> 01:38:24,541
<b>I thought you signed up the team a couple of months ago for</b>

734
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:26,916
<b>the lambda track after a meeting.</b>

735
01:38:27,541 --> 01:38:28,708
<b>But it's okay if you did.</b>

736
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,125
<b>It's okay if you did not.</b>

737
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:33,250
<b>I can take care of that today.</b>

738
01:38:34,125 --> 01:38:36,958
<b>I just needed to know whether you did or not.</b>

739
01:38:37,958 --> 01:38:39,958
<b>No, I didn't do the registration.</b>

740
01:38:40,208 --> 01:38:41,750
<b>We were discussing about whether</b>

741
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,750
<b>to use lambda and the other track.</b>

742
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:47,041
<b>So if you want me to register, I can do that.</b>

743
01:38:47,875 --> 01:38:49,083
<b>Or otherwise you can do it.</b>

744
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,000
<b>Whichever way is fine.</b>

745
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:51,208
<b>Okay.</b>

746
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,000
<b>That's fine.</b>

747
01:38:53,125 --> 01:38:55,208
<b>Yeah, I'm just going to do that.</b>

748
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:58,125
<b>Let me see if I can find it.</b>

749
01:38:58,333 --> 01:38:58,500
<b>Yeah.</b>

750
01:38:59,583 --> 01:39:01,125
<b>Don't worry about it.</b>

751
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:07,125
<b>I'll make sure that's added to the team</b>

752
01:39:07,125 --> 01:39:09,291
<b>briefing document too as an action item.</b>

753
01:39:11,166 --> 01:39:11,583
<b>Okay.</b>

754
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:13,416
<b>I have to sign up.</b>

755
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:15,666
<b>Okay.</b>

756
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:16,750
<b>I have to team sign up.</b>

757
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:19,625
<b>Okay, no worries.</b>

758
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:25,750
<b>Yeah, I think we covered everything.</b>

759
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:27,375
<b>Yeah.</b>

760
01:39:27,708 --> 01:39:29,083
<b>It's kind of a lot to do today.</b>

761
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:31,416
<b>I also got to call my mom check in with</b>

762
01:39:31,416 --> 01:39:33,583
<b>her because I haven't heard from her yet.</b>

763
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:38,000
<b>I got to make sure she's doing well too.</b>

764
01:39:39,416 --> 01:39:41,000
<b>But yeah, I will continue to give</b>

765
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,208
<b>you guys updates throughout today.</b>

766
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:48,083
<b>And the first thing I'll create is that briefing document.</b>

767
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,375
<b>Okay, great.</b>

768
01:39:49,666 --> 01:39:49,875
