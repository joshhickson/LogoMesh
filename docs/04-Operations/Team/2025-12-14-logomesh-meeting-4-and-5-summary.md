# LogoMesh Meeting Summary

**Date:** December 14, 2025

**Attendees:** Josh, Deepti

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Competition Strategy:** Deepti proposed that the team participate in both available competitions:
    *   Custom Track: Focusing on the Green Agent.
    *   Lambda Track: Focusing on the Red Agent.
*   **Feasibility:** Participation in both tracks is considered viable as the core LogoMesh Project priority is the Security Track, and the Lambda Track aligns with a security focus.

## Action Items

*   **Josh:** Will research the competitions further and share details with the team. Josh also shared the Jules demo with Deepti.
*   **Deepti:** Will utilize the Jules demo to advance the project work.

## Future Suggestions

*   The discussion also included the potential introduction of:
    *   Sub-agents
    *   Agents
    *   Judge agents

### **Summary**

The **LogoMesh** project aims to solve the problem of **"Contextual Debt"** in AI-generated code—the phenomenon where AI coding agents (like "Google Jules" or AWS agents) lose alignment with high-level business logic and project specifications over time due to limited context windows.

To address this, the team is developing a **Green Agent** (an evaluator/proctor) that utilizes a novel mathematical metric called the **Contextual Integrity Score (CIS)**. This agent evaluates whether code generated by other agents ("Purple Agents") aligns with the original project specifications and business vision.

For the immediate purpose of the **Agent Beats competition** (Phase 1 deadline approx. Jan 14, 2026), the team has decided to narrow their scope to a **Cybersecurity** use case (internally branded as "Cyber Sentinel"), using security compliance as a tangible proxy for "contextual integrity."

### **1. Meeting Analysis: LogoMesh Meeting 4 (Samuel & Mark)**

**Participants:** Josh (Lead), Samuel (Biomedical/AI Engineer, Singapore), Mark (AWS Evaluation Engineer, Seattle).

* **Team Composition & Capabilities:**
* **Mark (New Teammate):** Currently works at AWS (Elabres team) on the evaluation pipeline for their newly released "DevOps agent." He brings deep industry experience in agent evaluation, datasets, and red-teaming. He is self-taught, having transitioned from carpentry to coding to address the "contextual debt" he encountered while using AI for personal projects.
* **Samuel:** Specializes in computer vision and AI coding, with experience at Endeavor AI automating sales processes. He has already begun implementing the Green Agent.


* **Technical Discussions:**
* **The Green Agent's Role:** Mark initially confused the Green Agent with an *orchestration* agent (one that selects fighters for a battle). Josh clarified that the Green Agent is an **evaluator/proctor** that sits outside the "game" to grade the actions of other agents using the CIS metric.
* **Contextual Integrity Score (CIS):** They discussed validating the CIS by comparing it against a standard LLM-based judge. If the CIS correlates with the LLM judge but is more mathematically rigorous or efficient, it proves the metric's novelty.
* **Security Focus:** While LogoMesh is a holistic framework, the team agreed to focus on **Cybersecurity** for the competition. This allows them to use existing benchmarks (like "Cybergym") and provides a clear "pass/fail" environment to demonstrate the CIS utility.


* **Strategic Pivot (The "Lambda Track"):**
* Mark discovered a specific competition track called the **"Lambda Track"** (sponsored by Berkeley), which focuses on red-teaming and breaking security.
* He suggested this might be a better fit for his skillset (Kaggle-style optimization) than the "Custom Track" the team originally planned.

### **2. Meeting Analysis: LogoMesh Meeting 5 (Deepti)**

**Participants:** Josh (Lead), Deepti (Data Scientist).

* **Strategic Decision: The "Dual Track" Approach:**
* Josh and Deepti discussed Mark's proposal to switch to the Lambda Track.
* **Decision:** Rather than pivoting the whole team and abandoning their "Custom Track" work (the holistic CIS framework), they will likely register a **second team** (technically allowed) to tackle the Lambda Track simultaneously. This leverages Mark's specific strengths in security red-teaming without sacrificing the broader LogoMesh vision.
* **Scope Definition:** For the Custom Track, they will still use **Security** as the "Proof of Concept" domain. The narrative will be: *“Security is just one planet in the LogoMesh universe; we are proving the CIS works here first before expanding to general business logic alignment.”*


* **Technical & Operational Issues:**
* **SSH/GitHub Access:** Deepti reported issues connecting to the repository via SSH despite having public keys configured. Josh recommended using **GitHub Desktop** as a workaround while they diagnose the terminal issues.
* **Tooling:** Josh provided a demo of **"Google Jules,"** an interactive AI agent he uses for high-level repository management and documentation updates. He noted that Jules is effective but relies heavily on up-to-date documentation to avoid hallucinations.


* **External Validation:**
* Deepti mentioned her husband, a cybersecurity professional, reviewed the LogoMesh papers/whitepaper and was highly impressed, validating the "Cyber Sentinel" approach as a viable real-world product.

### **Key Action Items**

1. **Documentation:** Josh is overhauling the repository documentation to ensure agents (like Google Jules) and new teammates (Mark) have accurate context.
2. **Implementation:** Samuel is to continue coding the Green Agent foundation.
3. **Registration:** The team needs to register a second team entry to cover both the **Custom Track** (LogoMesh/CIS) and the **Lambda Track** (Security/Red Teaming).
4. **Onboarding:** Josh needs to facilitate a meeting between Mark, Deepti, and the rest of the team (Aladdin/Garrett) to align on the dual-track strategy.
