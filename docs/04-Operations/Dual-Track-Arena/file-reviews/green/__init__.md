# File Review: src/green_logic/__init__.py

## Summary
This file is currently empty and serves as a package marker for the `green_logic` module, enabling Python to recognize the directory as a package.

## Key Components
- No code or definitions are present.
- Its presence allows for relative and absolute imports within the `green_logic` package.

## Usage
Required for Python package structure and import resolution. No direct functionality.

## Assessment
- **Strengths:**
  - Correctly included for package recognition.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - None; file is intentionally empty.

**Conclusion:**
This file is a standard, empty `__init__.py` used to mark the `green_logic` directory as a Python package. No further review required unless package-level initialization is needed in the future.
