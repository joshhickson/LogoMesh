# **Unified Roadmap: LogoMesh**

## **From "Competition Weapon" to "Enterprise Gate"**

**Status:** Strategic Baseline

**Scope:** feat/cli-and-mcp (Technical) \+ Go-to-Market (Business)

## **1\. Executive Summary: The "Weapon" & "The Gate"**

We are merging two competing visions into a single, phased execution plan.

1. **The "Weapon" (Phase 1):** A local-first, adversarial CLI tool. It is designed to win the **AgentBeats Phase Purple** competition by "pre-grading" its own code generation. It is built for **Power Users** who want to generate battle-tested code without cloud costs.  
2. **The "Gate" (Phase 2):** An enterprise-grade CI/CD enforcement tool. It wraps the "Weapon" in a Docker container to block "Contextual Debt" from entering the repo. It is built for **CISOs** who need liability protection.

**The Strategic Pivot:**

We explicitly reject the "GitHub PR Bot" (CodeRabbit Clone) model. We cannot win on convenience. We win on **Falsification**—proving code is broken before it ships.

## **2\. Phase 1: The Engine (Now – March 31, 2026\)**

**Goal:** Dominate AgentBeats Phase Purple & Launch MVP.

This phase focuses on the **Architect Mode** (The Builder). We are building a "Purple Agent" that has an internal "Green Agent" (Judge) and "Red Agent" (Attacker) inside its brain.

### **Deliverables**

* **LogoMesh CLI (logomesh build):**  
  * **Local-First:** Uses vllm (Qwen/Llama 3\) for privacy and zero-cost Red Teaming.  
  * **Adversarial Loop:** Implements the "Cybernetic Loop" where code is rejected if the Red Agent's MCTS attacks succeed.  
  * **Pivot Feature:** **Adaptive Compute.** The CLI decides whether to run a fast generation (System 1\) or a deep Red Team loop (System 2\) based on task complexity.  
* **MCP Server:**  
  * Exposes assess\_code\_quality and generate\_feature to VS Code (Copilot/Cursor).  
  * Allows developers to invoke the Red Agent directly from their IDE.  
* **A2A Adapter (Competition Wrapper):**  
  * A thin FastAPI wrapper (purple\_server.py) that accepts A2A JSON-RPC tasks.  
  * It treats the AgentBeats competition as just another "User" asking for code.

### **Success Criteria**

* **Competition:** Top 10 Finish in AgentBeats Phase Purple.  
* **Product:** Functional local CLI that can "fix its own bugs" without human intervention.

## **3\. Phase 2: The Gate (April – June 2026\)**

**Goal:** Enterprise CI/CD Pilot.

This phase focuses on the **Auditor Mode** (The Checker). We take the engine from Phase 1 and deploy it as a "Guard Dog" for repositories.

### **The "Anti-CodeRabbit" Strategy**

Instead of a "Helpful Bot" that comments on PRs (which developers ignore), we build a **Blocking Gate**.

* **The Artifact:** **GitHub Action** (Dockerized LogoMesh).  
* **The Workflow:**  
  1. Developer pushes code.  
  2. LogoMesh Action runs (Auditor Mode).  
  3. It builds a **Dependency Graph** (Pivot Directive 2).  
  4. It checks for **Architectural Violations** (e.g., "Feature A imports Deprecated Lib B").  
  5. **Pass/Fail:** If violations exist, the build fails. No chat. No suggestions. Just "Fix it."

### **Deliverables**

* **LogoMesh Docker Image:** Optimized container with pre-installed sentence-transformers and lightweight scoring logic.  
* **GitHub Action:** Plug-and-play YAML configuration for enterprise repos.  
* **Graph Analysis Module:** New logic to detect "Spaghetti Code" and "Illegal Imports" that vectors miss.

## **4\. Phase 3: The Truth (July 2026+)**

**Goal:** CISO Dashboard & Liability Protection.

This phase monetizes **Fear & Compliance**. We sell the "Proof of Diligence."

### **The "DBOM" (Decision Bill of Materials)**

Enterprises are terrified of "AI Liability." If Copilot writes a bug that causes a breach, who is to blame?

* **The Product:** A Web Dashboard that hosts DBOMs generated by the CLI.  
* **The Pitch:** "Don't just ship code. Ship the proof that you Red Teamed it."  
* **The Artifact:** A cryptographically signed PDF/JSON showing:  
  * The Intent (What was asked).  
  * The Attacks (What MCTS tried).  
  * The Result (Why it passed).

### **Deliverables**

* **Web Dashboard:** SaaS platform to view and audit DBOMs.  
* **Jira Integration:** Link DBOMs to Jira Tickets (Closing the loop on "Contextual Integrity").

## **5\. Appendix: Reconciliation with Market Research**

*Comparison with sszz01’s Research (`20260203-message-szz01-1`, `20260203-message-szz01-2`)*

| Feature / Strategy | sszz01's Plan | Unified Roadmap | Reasoning |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Entry Point** | GitHub App (PR Bot) | **Local CLI \+ MCP** | Avoid CodeRabbit competition; win on "Active Building." |
| **Compute** | Cloud GPU | **Local (vLLM)** | Zero marginal cost; allows offensive Red Teaming without TOS bans. |
| **Monetization** | SaaS Subscription | **Freemium CLI / Paid Enterprise** | Hook devs with the tool; sell the "Gate" and "Dashboard" to CISOs. |
| **Competition** | (Not Mentioned) | **Core Driver** | Building the CLI *is* building the Purple Agent. Dual-use efficiency. |
| **Target User** | Team Lead | **Power User \-\> CISO** | Bottom-up adoption via CLI; Top-down check via Dashboard. |

**Bottom Line:** We accept the *market need* identified by sszz01 (Enterprise Integrity), but we reject the *delivery mechanism* (Chatbot). We deliver a Weapon first, then a Gate.
