# Scenario 013: DevShell Workflow Orchestration - One-Command Control Tower

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** Draft (from Story #15)  
**Priority:** Critical (DevShell Command Orchestration)

## Scenario Overview

Sara (lead dev), Jules (AI pair programmer), and a QA bot coordinate through DevShell's command palette system during a fast-paced feature development session. This scenario stress-tests DevShell's natural language command rewriting, security governance, hot-swappable command packs, and history-aware rollback capabilities.

## Setup Context

- **Team:** 3 participants (human dev + AI assistant + CI bot)
- **Hardware:** MacBook Pro M2, headless 4090 tower, GitHub runner
- **DevShell State:** Shared manifest with git, build, ai-assist, sec-panel packs
- **Security Requirement:** Yubikey authentication + privacy compliance
- **Workflow Pressure:** Live feature branch with failing tests

## The Control Tower Sequence

### Phase 1: Context-Aware Project Entry (T+14:03)
Sara executes: `devshell open branch=f/story-graphs`
- Command palette autocompletes based on git context
- DevShell spawns context bubble with PR summaries and test failures
- Cross-device manifest synchronization with Jules and QA bot

**DevShell Challenge:** Real-time context aggregation and intelligent autocompletion

### Phase 2: AI Security Gate Enforcement (T+14:07)
Jules runs: `devshell ai-suggest refactor IdeaManager`
- Security Panel detects "accessing proprietary LLM weights"
- Yubikey challenge required before proceeding
- Cross-device security policy enforcement

**DevShell Challenge:** Granular permission system with hardware token integration

### Phase 3: Privacy-Aware Chain-of-Thought Control (T+14:10)
Sara toggles: `sec show → "LLM internal reasoning" → OFF`
- Live policy update affects Jules' AI processing
- Chain-of-thought redaction in real-time
- Privacy compliance without breaking workflow

**DevShell Challenge:** Dynamic security policy propagation across team

### Phase 4: Smart-Crash Isolation Under Load (T+14:18)
Build command: `devshell build --watch` triggers crash
- Rogue graphviz-render pack consumes 1GB RAM
- Auto-isolation prevents system-wide failure  
- Selective restart maintains build process

**DevShell Challenge:** Plugin isolation with service continuity

### Phase 5: Natural Language Command Translation (T+14:22)
Command palette: `⌘+P → "fix tslint warnings"`
- NL input converts to concrete shell commands
- Transaction bundling: lint + commit in atomic operation
- One-keystroke execution of complex workflows

**DevShell Challenge:** Reliable NL-to-command translation with transaction safety

### Phase 6: Surgical History Rollback (T+14:40)
Failed integration tests trigger: `devshell undo 2`
- Selective rollback of last 2 DevShell transactions
- Git history preservation for non-DevShell commits
- State consistency across distributed team

**DevShell Challenge:** Transaction-aware rollback without git contamination

### Phase 7: Ephemeral Resource Management (T+14:55)
VR spatial analysis: `devshell vr up` → work → `vr down`
- On-demand MatrixCore GPU allocation
- 10-minute time-boxed VR session
- Instant resource cleanup on exit

**DevShell Challenge:** Dynamic resource allocation with automatic cleanup

### Phase 8: Compliance Audit Generation (T+15:05)
Documentation: `devshell audit export --range 14:00-15:05`
- Signed command log generation
- Smart-crash incident reports
- Security policy change documentation
- Automated compliance attachment to PR

**DevShell Challenge:** Comprehensive audit trail with legal compliance

## Stress Test Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Natural Language Command Processing:** Reliable translation of human intent to executable commands
2. **Cross-Device Security Governance:** Consistent policy enforcement across distributed team
3. **Intelligent Resource Management:** Dynamic allocation and cleanup of system resources
4. **Transaction-Aware History:** Surgical rollback without affecting non-DevShell operations
5. **Plugin Isolation & Recovery:** Smart crash handling with service continuity

### Secondary Goals
1. **Real-Time Context Awareness:** Intelligent autocompletion based on project state
2. **Compliance Documentation:** Automated audit trail generation
3. **Privacy Policy Enforcement:** Dynamic chain-of-thought redaction
4. **Hot-Swappable Command Packs:** Runtime plugin management without restart

## Gap Analysis

### Discovered Gaps

**GAP-DEVSHELL-006: Natural Language Command Translation Framework**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Description:** DevShell lacks robust NL-to-command translation with safety guarantees
- **Missing Capabilities:**
  - Intent recognition with confidence scoring
  - Command validation before execution
  - Transaction bundling for atomic operations
  - Rollback-safe command generation

**GAP-DEVSHELL-007: Cross-Device Security Policy Propagation**
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** No system for real-time security policy updates across distributed team
- **Missing Capabilities:**
  - Live policy synchronization across devices
  - Hardware token integration (Yubikey, etc.)
  - Granular permission management per command pack
  - Privacy-aware processing control

**GAP-DEVSHELL-008: Ephemeral Resource Management**
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Missing dynamic resource allocation and automatic cleanup system
- **Missing Capabilities:**
  - Time-boxed resource sessions
  - GPU/CPU allocation quotas per user/session
  - Automatic resource cleanup on exit/crash
  - Resource contention resolution

**GAP-DEVSHELL-009: Transaction-Aware History Management**
- **Priority:** Medium-High
- **Description:** DevShell cannot distinguish its operations from external git/system changes
- **Missing Capabilities:**
  - DevShell transaction tagging and isolation
  - Surgical rollback without git contamination
  - State consistency verification across rollbacks
  - Cross-device transaction synchronization

**GAP-DEVSHELL-010: Plugin Hot-Swap & Crash Isolation**
- **Priority:** Medium-High
- **Description:** No system for runtime plugin management with failure isolation
- **Missing Capabilities:**
  - Runtime command pack loading/unloading
  - Plugin failure isolation and recovery
  - Service continuity during plugin crashes
  - Resource leak prevention during pack swaps

**GAP-DEVSHELL-011: Context-Aware Command Completion**

  - Cross-team context sharing

### Integration Issues
- **DevShell ↔ Security Panel:** Real-time policy updates need EventBus coordination
- **DevShell ↔ Audit Trail:** High-frequency command logging can overwhelm audit system
- **DevShell ↔ Resource Management:** GPU/CPU allocation needs coordination with VTC and other systems
- **DevShell ↔ Plugin System:** Hot-swap operations need coordination with PluginHost

## Combined DevShell Gap Summary

Between Scenario 012 (Crisis Management) and Scenario 013 (Workflow Orchestration), DevShell emerges as needing **11 distinct gap areas**:

### Crisis Management Gaps (Scenario 012):
- GAP-DEVSHELL-001: Autonomous Crisis Coordination Framework
- GAP-DEVSHELL-002: Meta-Cognitive Loop Protection  
- GAP-DEVSHELL-003: Multi-Language Runtime Coordination
- GAP-DEVSHELL-004: Real-Time Debugging Constraints
- GAP-DEVSHELL-005: Natural Language Debugging Interface

### Workflow Orchestration Gaps (Scenario 013):
- GAP-DEVSHELL-006: Natural Language Command Translation Framework
- GAP-DEVSHELL-007: Cross-Device Security Policy Propagation
- GAP-DEVSHELL-008: Ephemeral Resource Management
- GAP-DEVSHELL-009: Transaction-Aware History Management
- GAP-DEVSHELL-010: Plugin Hot-Swap & Crash Isolation
- GAP-DEVSHELL-011: Context-Aware Command Completion

**DevShell is revealed as LogoMesh's most complex subsystem** - it must serve as both crisis manager AND workflow orchestrator while maintaining security, performance, and usability.
