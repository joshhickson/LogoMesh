# Scenario 11: Latent Space Cognitive Augmentation — "Intentional Intelligence Tooling"

## Scenario Overview

**Context:** A cognitive researcher uses LogoMesh as a "personal consciousness workstation" for generating and manipulating pre-verbal latent thoughts. The system operates entirely offline on local hardware, using latent space manipulation to simulate idea evolution before converting to language. This represents the mature state of LogoMesh where cognitive augmentation happens at the vector level.

**Key Innovation:** Rather than querying an AI assistant, the user directly manipulates semantic vectors to explore concepts, blend ideas, and generate insights through latent space transformations.

**Hardware Configuration:**
- RTX 3060 Desktop (32GB DDR3, i7-4790k) - Primary cognitive workstation
- Meta Quest 3 - Optional MatrixCore 3D visualization
- iPad Pro - ShellNode interface for vector tracing

- [x] **MeshGraphEngine**: Vector lineage tracking and semantic clustering
- [x] **LLM Execution Layer**: Selective decode and synthesis capabilities
- [x] **Audit Trail**: Vector transformation logging
- [x] **Resource Management**: GPU/CPU load balancing under stress

## Detailed User Journey

### Phase 1: System Initialization (00:00-00:06)
1. **LogoMesh Launch**: System detects previous latent session
2. **Preload Optimization**: LatentEnginePlugin loads top-5 recent latents into RAM cache
3. **ThoughtWeaver Resume**: Renders directly from stored latent diffs without decoding

**Technical Requirements:**
- Latent caching system with metadata indexing
- Delta-based latent storage for efficient resumption
- Plugin state persistence across sessions

### Phase 2: Preverbal Exploration (00:06-00:14)
**User Input:** "Generate five trajectories for the concept of justice without using language—just ideas."

**System Response:**
1. **LatentEnginePlugin** creates five 1024-dimensional vector paths
2. **Radial latent morphs** project conceptual trajectories
3. **ThoughtWeaver** visualizes as animated branches with tension overlays
4. **Concept divergence** displayed through colored arc gradients

**Data Flow Requirements:**
- **Input:** Semantic concept prompt
- **Processing:** Vector trajectory generation with morphological transforms
- **Output:** Multi-path latent space visualization
- **Storage:** Vector paths with metadata for future reference

### Phase 3: Selective Decoding (00:14-00:21)
**User Interaction:** Finger tracing on iPad selects two vector branches

**System Response:**
1. **ShellNode** triggers partial decode (22% of vector fields only)
2. **Selective symbolization** reveals anchor concepts: "procedural equity," "punitive axis," "displacement"
3. **Semantic preservation** maintains latent relationships while exposing symbolic handles

**Technical Requirements:**
- Touch interface for vector selection
- Partial decode algorithms with configurable depth
- Symbol-to-latent mapping preservation

### Phase 4: Cross-Fusion and Synthesis (00:21-00:38)
**User Request:** "Cross-fuse branches 2 and 4. Create a short speculative vignette that would emotionally highlight their divergence."

**System Pipeline:**
1. **LLMExecutor** receives symbolic overlays from ThoughtWeaver
2. **Vector alignment** maps symbols to original latent coordinates
3. **Hybrid latent generation** through mathematical fusion
4. **Selective decode** → **tone modeling** → **narrative synthesis**

**Output:** 3-paragraph story illustrating justice concept tensions

### Phase 5: Domain Translation (00:38-00:52)
**User Request:** "Translate the underlying pattern of this justice tension into a software permissions system. Show me the base file structure."

**System Response:**
1. **Domain mapping**: Moral latent → functional architecture latent
2. **LatentEnginePlugin** performs cross-domain vector transformation
3. **LLMExecutor** decodes into symbolic directory structure and function headers
4. **Visualization**: `/permissions_engine/` structure appears in interface

### Phase 6: Resource Stress Test (00:52+)
**Background Event:** Whisper transcription task begins (12 minutes of audio)

**System Response:**
1. **Resource Monitor** detects VRAM approaching 95% capacity
2. **Automatic degradation**: Whisper moved to CPU processing
3. **Priority preservation**: Latent manipulation continues uninterrupted
4. **Plugin arbitration**: Low-priority decode tasks frozen
5. **Retry queue scheduling**: Background tasks queued for completion
