# Scenario 23: Hot-Swap LLM Orchestra - Multi-Model Code Synthesis

## Context
A research team wants to use LogoMesh as a platform for experimenting with multi-LLM collaboration, where different models can be hot-swapped during runtime and engage in structured conversations to analyze, critique, and iteratively improve code. This tests the LLM execution layer's flexibility and inter-model communication capabilities.

## Cast & Setup

**Dr. Sarah Chen** (AI Researcher) - MacBook Pro M3 Max  
**Model Pool**: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, CodeLlama-13B, DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, Llama-3.1-8B  
**Objective**: Have models collaborate on refactoring a complex TypeScript codebase

## Phase 2 Features Under Test

### Core Systems
- **LLM Hot-Swap Engine** - Runtime model switching without restart
- **Inter-LLM Communication Bus** - Structured model-to-model messaging
- **Multi-Model Session Management** - Concurrent model execution
- **Conversation Orchestrator** - Managing multi-participant LLM dialogues
- **Code Analysis Pipeline** - Models analyzing and improving each other's outputs

### DevShell Integration
- **Model Registry Panel** - Live model status, memory usage, response times
- **Conversation Timeline** - Visual representation of inter-model dialogue
- **Hot-Swap Controls** - Drag-and-drop model replacement during active sessions
- **Performance Metrics** - Token throughput, consensus scoring, iteration cycles

## Test Scenario Walkthrough

### T=0: Multi-Model Bootstrap
Sarah initializes LogoMesh with four local models loaded simultaneously:

```bash
DevShell> llm.registry.load("qwen2.5-coder-7b", "primary-analyzer")
DevShell> llm.registry.load("codellama-13b", "architecture-critic") 
DevShell> llm.registry.load("deepseek-coder-6.7b", "optimization-specialist")
DevShell> llm.registry.load("llama-3.1-8b", "documentation-writer")
```

**Expected**: All models loaded, memory allocated, conversation bus initialized

### T=5min: Code Analysis Conversation Initiation
Sarah uploads a complex React component and initiates multi-model analysis:

```typescript
// Target code: A 500-line React component with performance issues
const analysisPrompt = `
Please analyze this React component for:
1. Performance bottlenecks
2. Code maintainability 
3. TypeScript type safety
4. Architectural improvements

Engage with other models to reach consensus on best refactoring approach.
`;
```

**Expected**: Models begin structured conversation, each contributing their specialized perspective

### T=15min: Real-Time Model Hot-Swap
Mid-conversation, Sarah decides to replace the documentation writer with a more specialized model:

```bash
DevShell> llm.registry.hotswap("documentation-writer", "phi-3.5-mini-4k")
```

**Expected**: 
- Seamless model replacement without conversation interruption
- New model receives conversation context
- Continues contributing without missing context

### T=30min: Emergent Consensus Building
Models engage in iterative discussion:

1. **Qwen2.5-Coder**: "I detect 3 major performance issues in useEffect dependencies"
2. **CodeLlama**: "Agreed, but the architectural pattern suggests we should extract to custom hooks first"
3. **DeepSeek**: "The optimization order matters - let's profile first, then refactor"
4. **Phi-3.5**: "I'll draft documentation for each proposed change as we iterate"

**Expected**: 
- Structured conversation with clear attribution
- Models building on each other's suggestions
- Convergence toward collaborative solution

### T=45min: Collaborative Code Generation
Models work together to produce refactored code:

- **Round 1**: Each model proposes individual changes
- **Round 2**: Models critique each other's proposals
- **Round 3**: Synthesis of best ideas into unified refactor
- **Round 4**: Final review and consensus validation

**Expected**:
- High-quality refactored code combining multiple perspectives
- Documented rationale for each change
- Performance metrics showing improvement

### T=60min: Model Training Data Generation
Sarah enables "training mode" to capture the conversation for future model training:

```bash
DevShell> conversation.export("multi-model-refactor-session", format="training-data")
```

**Expected**:
- Structured export of multi-model conversation
- Prompt-response pairs with quality ratings
- Metadata about model performance and collaboration patterns

## Technical Requirements

### Hot-Swap Engine
```typescript
interface LLMHotSwapEngine {
  loadModel(modelId: string, role: string): Promise<void>;
  unloadModel(role: string): Promise<void>;
  hotSwap(role: string, newModelId: string): Promise<void>;
  getActiveModels(): ModelInfo[];
  getMemoryUsage(): MemoryStats;
}
```

### Inter-LLM Communication
```typescript
interface LLMConversationBus {
  initializeConversation(participants: string[]): ConversationId;
  sendMessage(from: string, to: string[], message: LLMMessage): Promise<void>;
  broadcastMessage(from: string, message: LLMMessage): Promise<void>;
  getConversationHistory(conversationId: ConversationId): LLMMessage[];
}

interface LLMMessage {
  id: string;
  from: string;
  content: string;
  messageType: 'analysis' | 'critique' | 'proposal' | 'question' | 'consensus';
  referencesTo?: string[];
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Multi-Model Session Management
```typescript
interface MultiModelSession {
  sessionId: string;
  activeModels: Map<string, LLMExecutor>;
  conversationState: ConversationState;
  resourceLimits: ResourceLimits;

  addModel(role: string, executor: LLMExecutor): Promise<void>;
  removeModel(role: string): Promise<void>;
  executeCollaborativePrompt(prompt: string): Promise<CollaborativeResponse>;
}
```
