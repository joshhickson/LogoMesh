# Scenario: Code Ninjas Helping Hands That Scale

**Date:** January 30, 2025  
**Complexity:** High  
**Category:** Creative Applications/Performance Extremes

## Scenario Description

A Code Ninjas franchise deploys LogoMesh-Edu on a resource-constrained Intel NUC (16GB RAM) to manage real-time educational support for 20 students using Chrome-only laptops without admin rights. The system must coordinate multi-language development environments (JavaScript → Unity/C#), provide intelligent help queue management, and deliver actionable insights—all while maintaining sub-3-second response times and operating within strict hardware constraints.

The deployment emphasizes offline-first PWA architecture, real-time priority scheduling, and AI-powered pattern recognition for educational workflows.

## User Journey

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Class Initialization (T+16:05):** Twenty students log in via PWA, StudentBeacon establishes connections and assigns to Class 4-Green room
2. **Error Detection & Queuing (T+16:14):** Emma's JavaScript compile error triggers StudentBeacon, AssistQueue scores and prioritizes help request
3. **Intelligent Triage (T+16:17):** Queue overflow triggers triage mode, LinterLite-Py auto-resolves trivial syntax errors without human intervention
4. **Resource Management (T+16:33):** Unity build causes CPU spike, scheduler demotes PatternMiner to preserve real-time queue responsiveness
5. **Network Resilience (T+16:45):** 30-second LAN outage triggers offline-queue mode, events stored locally and replayed without data loss
6. **Session Analysis (T+17:02):** PatternMiner-TinyLLM processes session logs, generates curriculum insights and improvement recommendations

### Expected Outcomes
- 58 help requests processed with 43 auto-resolved (74% automation rate)
- Average wait time reduced from 9 minutes to 2 minutes 11 seconds
- Zero data loss during network interruptions
- Real-time dashboard maintains sub-3-second response times under full load
- Actionable curriculum insights delivered without manual analysis

## Gap Analysis

### Discovered Gaps

**GAP-EDU-001: Multi-Language Plugin Resource Coordination**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Systems:** Plugin System, TaskEngine
- **Description:** No framework for coordinating resource allocation across heterogeneous plugin runtimes (JS, Python, C#, React) with different performance characteristics.

**GAP-EDU-002: PWA Offline-First Event Architecture**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Systems:** API & Backend, Audit Trail System
- **Description:** No offline-first PWA framework with local event queuing, delta synchronization, and idempotent replay capabilities for network-unreliable environments.

**GAP-EDU-003: Real-Time Priority Scheduling**
- **Priority:** High
- **Systems:** TaskEngine & CCE
- **Description:** No dynamic priority scheduler that can demote background tasks (AI analysis) when real-time workloads (help queue) require immediate attention.

**GAP-EDU-004: Intelligent Auto-Suggestion Pipeline**
- **Priority:** High
- **Systems:** Plugin System, LLM Infrastructure
- **Description:** No framework for AI-powered auto-fix generation with confidence scoring and opt-in delivery to student endpoints.
