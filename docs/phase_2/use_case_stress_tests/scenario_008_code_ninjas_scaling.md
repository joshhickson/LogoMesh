# Scenario: Code Ninjas Helping Hands That Scale

**Date:** January 30, 2025  
**Complexity:** High  
**Category:** Creative Applications/Performance Extremes

## Scenario Description

A Code Ninjas franchise deploys LogoMesh-Edu on a resource-constrained Intel NUC (16GB RAM) to manage real-time educational support for 20 students using Chrome-only laptops without admin rights. The system must coordinate multi-language development environments (JavaScript → Unity/C#), provide intelligent help queue management, and deliver actionable insights—all while maintaining sub-3-second response times and operating within strict hardware constraints.

The deployment emphasizes offline-first PWA architecture, real-time priority scheduling, and AI-powered pattern recognition for educational workflows.

## User Journey

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Class Initialization (T+16:05):** Twenty students log in via PWA, StudentBeacon establishes connections and assigns to Class 4-Green room
2. **Error Detection & Queuing (T+16:14):** Emma's JavaScript compile error triggers StudentBeacon, AssistQueue scores and prioritizes help request
3. **Intelligent Triage (T+16:17):** Queue overflow triggers triage mode, LinterLite-Py auto-resolves trivial syntax errors without human intervention
4. **Resource Management (T+16:33):** Unity build causes CPU spike, scheduler demotes PatternMiner to preserve real-time queue responsiveness
5. **Network Resilience (T+16:45):** 30-second LAN outage triggers offline-queue mode, events stored locally and replayed without data loss
6. **Session Analysis (T+17:02):** PatternMiner-TinyLLM processes session logs, generates curriculum insights and improvement recommendations

### Expected Outcomes
- 58 help requests processed with 43 auto-resolved (74% automation rate)
- Average wait time reduced from 9 minutes to 2 minutes 11 seconds
- Zero data loss during network interruptions
- Real-time dashboard maintains sub-3-second response times under full load
- Actionable curriculum insights delivered without manual analysis

# Scenario: Code Ninjas Helping Hands That Scale

**Date:** January 30, 2025  
**Complexity:** High  
**Category:** Scalability/Multi-Tenant Architecture

## Scenario Description

The franchise owner of a Code Ninja academy discovers that their students learn programming concepts faster when they can visualize their code logic as interconnected thought graphs. They deploy LogoMesh across 8 franchise locations (Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Denver, Phoenix, Albuquerque, and Oklahoma City) to enable cross-location mentoring, shared curriculum development, and real-time collaboration between students working on similar projects.

## User Journey

### Setup Phase
- **Multi-Location Infrastructure**: Each franchise runs LogoMesh on local hardware (iPad + Mac mini) but shares curriculum graphs via EchoMesh P2P network
- **Student Account Management**: 240 total students (30 per location) with age-appropriate privacy controls and parental oversight
- **Curriculum Synchronization**: Programming concept graphs, project templates, and assessment rubrics sync across all locations
- **Cross-Location Mentoring**: Advanced students from any location can mentor beginners at other locations via shared thought spaces

### Peak Load Scenario
- **Simultaneous Usage**: All 8 locations running concurrent sessions (192 active students during peak after-school hours)
- **Curriculum Updates**: Live curriculum graph updates propagating across all locations during active sessions
- **Cross-Location Projects**: Students from different cities collaborating on the same Python game project
- **Real-Time Assessment**: Instructors monitoring student progress graphs with automated concept mastery detection
- **Emergency Coordination**: Dallas location experiences hardware failure - other locations automatically absorb their students

### Stress Factors
1. **Geographic Distribution**: 8 cities across 3 time zones with varying internet reliability
2. **Age-Appropriate Privacy**: COPPA compliance with parental controls and content filtering
3. **Curriculum Version Control**: Ensuring all locations use compatible curriculum versions while allowing local customization
4. **Load Balancing**: Automatic redistribution of compute load when locations go offline
5. **Mentorship Coordination**: Real-time matching of mentors and students across locations based on skill level and availability

**Classification:** Feature | P1 | Multi-Tenant Architecture  
**Systems Affected:** MeshGraphEngine, Storage Layer, Plugin System

**Problem Description:** No framework for franchise-specific curriculum modifications while maintaining compatibility and synchronization across the broader network.

**Current Phase 2 State:** MeshGraphEngine supports graph synchronization but lacks multi-tenant customization with inheritance and override capabilities.

**Required Solution:**
- Hierarchical curriculum inheritance (corporate → franchise → local)
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous updates
- Compatibility verification before propagation
- Local customization isolation with optional sharing

**Phase 3 Impact:** Franchise scalability blocked without flexible curriculum management.

### GAP-111: COPPA-Compliant Child Safety Framework
