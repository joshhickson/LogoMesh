# Scenario: The Distraction Detector Goes Live

**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Complexity:** Extreme  
**Category:** Performance Extremes

## Scenario Description

An investigative journalism collective deploys LogoMesh-PsyOps on a high-performance server to create a real-time "narrative radar" system. The system continuously monitors news sources and social media to detect potential distraction campaigns by correlating suspicious timing patterns between major political events and trending topics.

This scenario tests LogoMesh's ability to handle multi-language plugin ecosystems, real-time data ingestion at scale, sophisticated anomaly detection pipelines, and graceful recovery from individual component failures while maintaining data integrity across complex workflows.

## User Journey

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **12:00** - System initialization, NewsCrawler pulls baseline data, constructs spike matrix
2. **14:17** - High-impact legal event detected (Executive clemency announcement)
3. **14:22** - Simultaneous trending spike in unrelated topic (drone sightings)
4. **14:25** - EventSpikeTracker flags dual anomalies in different domains
5. **14:26** - PsyOpScoreModel analyzes correlation, returns 82% distraction likelihood
6. **14:27** - DashboardNode visualizes correlation with confidence metrics
7. **14:31** - API rate limiting causes TweetStreamer failure
8. **14:33** - RollbackCoordinator orchestrates recovery without data loss
9. **15:05** - System correctly identifies low-suspicion event (celebrity death)
10. **23:59** - Daily snapshot and data archival with integrity verification

### Expected Outcomes
- Real-time detection of suspicious narrative timing patterns
- Accurate correlation scoring between political events and media trends
- Graceful handling of individual plugin failures without system-wide impact
- Complete data integrity maintenance during partial system failures
- Transparent public dashboard with confidence metrics and disclaimers
