# Phase 2 Use Case Stress Tests

This directory contains creative use case scenarios designed to stress-test Phase 2 infrastructure and identify gaps in the system design.

## Systematic Workflow for New Stories

When processing a new creative use case story, follow this established methodology:

### Step 1: Story Analysis & Scenario Creation
1. **Extract the core scenario** from the attached story file
2. **Create a new scenario file** using the template: `scenario_XXX_[descriptive_name].md`
3. **Document the complete setup** including:
   - Context and background
   - Hardware/software configuration table
   - Expected workflow and outcomes
   - Technical requirements and constraints

### Step 2: Phase 2 Systems Mapping
1. **Map story requirements to Phase 2 systems** using checkboxes:
   - ✅ Systems directly involved and tested
   - ❌ Systems not applicable to this scenario
2. **Identify system interactions** and coordination points
3. **Document expected data flow** between systems
4. **Note any missing system capabilities** revealed by the scenario

### Step 3: Gap Discovery & Classification
1. **Identify specific gaps** using the gap analysis framework:
   - **ARCHITECTURAL** - Missing fundamental capabilities
   - **SECURITY** - Insufficient sandboxing/permissions
   - **INTEGRATION** - Poor system communication
   - **PERFORMANCE** - Scalability/resource issues
   - **UI/UX** - Missing interface components
   - **TESTING** - Inadequate mock behavior
   - **DOCUMENTATION** - Missing specifications

2. **Assign priority levels**:
   - **P0-CRITICAL** - Blocks Phase 2 foundation
   - **P1-HIGH** - Significantly impacts reliability
   - **P2-MEDIUM** - Quality-of-life improvement
   - **P3-LOW** - Nice-to-have enhancement

3. **Determine impact scope**:
   - **ISOLATED** - Single system affected
   - **SYSTEM** - Multiple related components
   - **CROSS-CUTTING** - Multiple unrelated systems
   - **FOUNDATIONAL** - Core architecture affected

### Step 4: Gap Documentation
1. **Document each gap** using the standard template:
   ```markdown
   ### GAP-XXX: [Brief Description]
   **Use Case:** [Which scenario revealed this]
   **Classification:** [Type] | [Priority] | [Scope]
   **Systems Affected:** [List specific Phase 2 systems]
   
   **Problem Description:** [Detailed explanation]
   **Current Phase 2 State:** [What exists that's insufficient]
   **Required Solution:** [What needs to be built/changed]
   **Phase 3 Impact:** [How this affects activation readiness]
   
   **Proposed Resolution:**
   - [ ] [Specific action item 1]
   - [ ] [Specific action item 2]
   
   **Status:** [OPEN/IN_PROGRESS/RESOLVED]
   ```

### Step 5: Gap Analysis Update
1. **Add new gaps** to `docs/phase_2/gap_analysis.md`
2. **Update the System Impact Matrix** with new gap counts
3. **Update Use Case Stress Test Results table** with scenario summary
4. **Recalculate totals** and identify new patterns/hotspots
5. **Update Analysis Summary** with revised statistics and priorities

### Step 6: Validation Planning
1. **Define test scenarios** to validate the use case works
2. **Create validation criteria** for each identified gap
3. **Document expected outcomes** and success metrics
4. **Plan integration testing** approach for the scenario

## Key Patterns Discovered

### Most Critical Integration Points
- **Multi-language plugin coordination** (appears in 6/8+ scenarios)
- **Real-time processing constraints** (impacts 5/8+ scenarios)
- **Resource management gaps** (affects 7/8+ scenarios)
- **Distributed coordination** (needed for 4/8+ scenarios)

### System Priority Rankings
Based on gap frequency and severity:
1. **Plugin System** - Highest impact (most gaps across all scenarios)
2. **TaskEngine & CCE** - Cross-cutting coordination issues
3. **Storage Layer** - Atomic operations and distributed state
4. **API & Backend** - Multiplayer and real-time networking
5. **LLM Infrastructure** - Resource management and quotas

### Common Gap Categories
- **Multi-language plugin runtime** coordination
- **Authoritative state management** for distributed scenarios
- **Real-time processing guarantees** with deadline scheduling
- **Resource quotas and thermal monitoring** for edge devices
- **Cross-device synchronization** protocols
- **Educational workflow orchestration** patterns

## Resume Instructions for AI Assistant

When continuing this workflow with new stories:

1. **Extract story content** from attached files
2. **Create new scenario file** with next sequential number
3. **Map to Phase 2 systems** using established checklist format
4. **Identify and document gaps** using classification framework
5. **Update gap_analysis.md** with new findings and revised statistics
