# Scenario 002: Philosophy Study Group Meltdown

**Classification:** PERFORMANCE + SECURITY + INTEGRATION  
**Complexity:** High  
**Systems:** Resource Management, Cross-Device Coordination, Plugin Health Monitoring

## Story Summary

Friday night: three remote users—Josh (desktop), Clara (Quest-based MatrixCore), and Alex (old iPad ShellNode)—open a shared EchoMesh channel to cram for an ethics exam.

### Node Configuration
| Node | Critical Plugins | Optional Plugins |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| Josh | Core DB, VTC, RAG-search | Experimental Text-to-Speech |
| Clara | MatrixCore-3D, Hand-Gesture IR | None |
| Alex | Lite-Canvas, Low-RAM summarizer | None |

### Event Chain

**20:17** Josh uploads a 120 MB PDF. The RAG plugin starts chunking and embedding it.

**20:18** Clara triggers a 3-D spatial query gesture; MatrixCore relays it to Josh's VTC.

**20:18:03** Josh's TTS plugin (not sandboxed) throws an out-of-memory exception, hogging 2 GB and slowing his local DB writes.

**20:18:12** Core's health monitor sees DB latency spike beyond the SLA threshold. It:
- Suspends the non-essential TTS plugin
- Captures a heap snapshot for later diagnostics  
- Rolls the DB back one transaction to guarantee index integrity

**20:18:27** Clara's query returns—250 ms slower than target but still live. She never notices.

**20:19** A notification hits Josh's audit panel: "TTS plugin suspended, memory leak suspected, heap dump saved." He can re-enable after patching or ignore.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Resource watchdogs detect memory leaks within 10 seconds
- [ ] Non-essential plugins can be killed without affecting core systems
- [ ] DB rollback prevents index corruption
- [ ] Cross-device coordination survives local node failures
- [ ] User notifications provide actionable diagnostics

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Simulate 120MB PDF processing with concurrent VTC queries
- [ ] Test plugin memory exhaustion scenarios
- [ ] Verify cross-device query routing during local stress
- [ ] Test automatic plugin suspension and recovery
- [ ] Validate DB rollback mechanisms

### Failure Modes
- Memory leak crashes entire system (CRITICAL FAILURE)
- DB corruption from incomplete transactions
- Cross-device queries timeout or fail
- Plugin suspension causes cascade failures
- No user notification of degraded performance

## Phase 2 Gap Analysis

### Jargon Translation
- "EchoMesh channel" → Future distributed communication system
- "MatrixCore-3D" → Future VR/AR plugin implementing PluginRuntimeInterface
- "Hand-Gesture IR" → Future input plugin with EventBus integration
- "RAG-search plugin" → Future plugin using VTC + LLM integration
- "Health monitor" → Enhanced PluginHost with resource monitoring
- "SLA threshold" → Configurable performance metrics in PluginAPI

### What's Missing from Current Phase 2

**CRITICAL GAPS:**

#### GAP-PERF-001: Resource Monitoring System
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Systems:** PluginHost, PluginAPI
- **Current State:** No memory or performance monitoring
- **Required:** Per-plugin resource tracking, configurable thresholds, automatic suspension

#### GAP-PERF-002: Transactional Rollback System
- **Priority:** Critical  
- **Systems:** SQLiteAdapter, PluginAPI
- **Current State:** No transaction state management across plugin boundaries
- **Required:** Atomic operation tracking, rollback triggers, integrity validation

#### GAP-DIST-001: Cross-Device State Coordination
- **Priority:** High
- **Systems:** EventBus, Plugin Communication
- **Current State:** EventBus is local-only
- **Required:** Distributed event routing, cross-device plugin coordination

#### GAP-MONITOR-001: Health Monitoring Dashboard
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Systems:** PluginHost, UI
- **Current State:** Basic plugin loading/unloading
- **Required:** Real-time health metrics, diagnostic tools, heap dump capture

### Architecture Assumptions
- PluginHost can monitor individual plugin resource usage
- SQLiteAdapter supports transaction rollback mechanisms
- EventBus can route messages across device boundaries
- Plugin suspension doesn't affect dependent plugin operations
- Audit logging captures sufficient diagnostic information

### Integration Issues
- No plugin resource isolation or monitoring capabilities
- SQLiteAdapter lacks transaction boundary management
- EventBus has no distributed coordination mechanisms
- Missing performance SLA configuration and enforcement
- No automated plugin suspension/recovery workflows

## Recommended Phase 2 Enhancements

**Priority 1: Plugin Resource Management**
- Add memory/CPU monitoring to PluginHost
- Implement plugin resource limits and automatic suspension
- Create plugin health status tracking system

**Priority 2: Transaction Safety**
- Add transaction boundary tracking to SQLiteAdapter
- Implement automatic rollback on plugin failures
- Create transaction integrity validation

**Priority 3: Cross-Device Coordination**
- Design distributed EventBus extension
- Add cross-device plugin state synchronization
- Implement graceful degradation for remote failures

**Priority 4: Monitoring Infrastructure**
- Create plugin health dashboard
- Add diagnostic data capture (heap dumps, performance metrics)
- Implement user notification system for plugin issues

## Validation Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Plugin resource consumption monitoring
- Transaction rollback mechanisms
- Cross-device message routing
- Plugin suspension/recovery workflows

### Integration Tests
- Multi-user scenario simulation
- Large file processing under stress
- Plugin failure cascade prevention
- Performance degradation handling

### Performance Tests
- 120MB file processing benchmarks
- Cross-device query latency under load
- Memory leak detection timing
- DB rollback performance impact
