**Date:** 06.10.2025  
**Complexity:** Extreme  
**Category:** Performance Extremes/Integration Challenges

## Scenario Description

A three-person mathematics research team uses LogoMesh to replicate and surpass Yang-Hui He's "murmuration" discovery on a massive 12-million elliptic curve dataset. This scenario stress-tests Phase 2 infrastructure with extreme computational loads, multi-GPU coordination, VR visualization, and comprehensive audit trails for mathematical research validation.

## User Journey

### Research Team Setup
- **Prof Dana (Number Theorist):** MacBook Air M3 (battery-powered) with DevShell command palette
- **Vic (ML Engineer):** 2Ã— A100 GPU node with CUDA monitoring and dataset ingestion tools  
- **Naomi (PhD Student):** Quest 3 VR + desktop RTX 4070 with spatial visualization capabilities

All devices share synchronized DevShell manifests and LogoMesh Core on a 64-core Linux host.

### Step-by-Step Research Workflow

#### Phase 1: Dataset Ingestion (Day 1, 09:00)
1. Dana initiates: `devshell run murmuration --dataset=/mnt/disks/curves.tar.zst`
2. DevShell automatically spawns distributed CurveIngestor jobs across Vic's A100 infrastructure
3. Security panel auto-flags "external dataset ingest" and encrypts processing hashes
4. Real-time progress monitoring across 12 million elliptic curve coefficient computations

#### Phase 2: Fault Tolerance Testing (Day 1, 13:10)
1. Corrupted tar chunk triggers segfault in worker process
2. Smart-Crash system isolates failing worker, restarts under new PID
3. Pipeline continues with only 0.04% data loss
4. DevShell logs incident for audit trail without global downtime

#### Phase 3: VR Pattern Discovery (Day 1, 18:45)
1. Naomi commands: `devshell vr up --projection="pc1,pc2"`
2. MatrixCore launches, streaming top two principal component projections
3. Hand-gesture lasso interaction reveals three dense oscillation bands
4. Discovery of rank-3 curve patterns previously unseen in mathematical literature

#### Phase 4: AI-Assisted Conjecture Generation (Day 1, 19:05)
1. Natural language VR command: "Summarise this band as a conjecture"
2. LLM-8B retrieves vector hits and drafts mathematical conjecture
3. Auto-generated conjecture with citations appears in DevShell buffer
4. Seamless transition from spatial intuition to formal mathematical language

#### Phase 5: Infrastructure Resilience (Day 2, 00:30)
1. Campus UPS test causes desktop GPU power loss
2. SmartViz automatically downgrades to web-only wireframe mode
3. Critical ingest pipeline remains unaffected
4. Graceful degradation maintains research continuity

#### Phase 6: Mathematical Validation (Day 2, 09:15)
1. Dana executes: `devshell birch-check --conjecture draft.md`
2. LLM checklist validates interpretation via PCA script
3. Security panel enables "chain-of-thought redact" for external sharing
4. Automated compliance checking for mathematical publication standards

#### Phase 7: Rollback Recovery (Day 2, 11:40)
1. Vic accidentally deploys buggy CUDA kernel affecting curves 7M-7.8M
2. NaN values detected in computation pipeline
3. `devshell undo 1` rolls back to snapshot #1425
4. Only 23 minutes of computational work lost

#### Phase 8: Research Export (Day 2, 18:00)
1. Command: `devshell audit export --range 48h --include vr`
2. Generates signed research package including:
   - Cryptographic hashes of all ingested data
   - GIF recordings of VR discovery sessions
   - Formal conjecture with mathematical citations
   - Reproducible Jupyter notebook (auto-generated)
