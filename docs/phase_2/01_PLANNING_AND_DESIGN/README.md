## Phase 2 Scope

Phase 2 focuses on enhancing the core framework with advanced filtering, graph visualization improvements, and foundational AI integration capabilities.

## Phase 2 Strategic Priorities

1. **Cognitive Sovereignty Architecture** - Implement user autonomy and anti-capture design
2. **Post-Transformer Readiness** - Prepare for next-generation AI architectures
3. **Agent Safety Prerequisites** - Establish bulletproof safety before automation
4. **Infrastructure Hardening** - Build robust, production-ready systems
5. **Anti-Capture Business Model** - Revenue streams that strengthen platform independence
6. **Comprehensive Testing** - Stress test all systems under realistic loads
7. **Gap Resolution** - Systematically address all discovered architectural gaps
8. **Security Foundation** - Implement comprehensive security and audit systems

### Constitutional Commitments (Phase 2)
- **Default-OFF sensors** - No data collection without explicit user choice
- **Fork-easy architecture** - Complete reproducibility and platform independence  
- **No mandatory cloud** - Full offline operation capability
- **Transparent AI reasoning** - Complete visibility into all AI decision processes
- **Cryptographic human authority** - Ultimate user control over all system operations
