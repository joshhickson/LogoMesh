## Audit Trail Architecture Overview

### Core Audit Principles

#### 1. Immutable Evidence Chain
**Gap Reference:** GAP-AUDIT-001, GAP-TRANSPARENCY-003
```typescript
interface AuditEvent {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  eventType: AuditEventType;
  actorId: string;
  targetResource: string;
  action: string;
  outcome: AuditOutcome;
  cryptographicProof: string;
  contextData: Record<string, any>;
  parentEventId?: string;
}

interface ImmutableAuditChain {
  events: AuditEvent[];
  blockHash: string;
  previousBlockHash: string;
  merkleRoot: string;
  digitalSignature: string;
}
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Every system interaction generates immutable audit event
- Cryptographic hash chains prevent tampering
- Distributed storage with redundancy across multiple nodes
- Real-time verification of audit chain integrity

#### 2. Universal System Integration
**Gap Reference:** GAP-AUDIT-002, GAP-INTEGRATION-015
```typescript
interface AuditableSystem {
  systemId: string;
  auditAdapter: SystemAuditAdapter;
  eventTypes: AuditEventType[];
  retentionPolicy: RetentionPolicy;
}

interface SystemAuditAdapter {
  captureEvent(event: SystemEvent): AuditEvent;
  queryEvents(query: AuditQuery): AuditEvent[];
  verifyIntegrity(): boolean;
}
```

**System Coverage:**
- **LLM Infrastructure:** All AI inferences, model switching, reasoning chains
- **Plugin System:** Plugin execution, permission changes, data access
- **Storage Layer:** All data operations, encryption, access patterns
- **TaskEngine:** Task execution, workflow coordination, resource allocation
- **DevShell:** Command execution, environment changes, file operations
- **API Gateway:** All external interactions, authentication, authorization
- **VTC & MeshGraphEngine:** Semantic analysis, graph modifications, traversals
