2. **Resource Allocation** - Assign specialized developers based on expertise areas
3. **Dependency Management** - Create detailed dependency graphs for parallel execution
4. **Timeline Validation** - Validate 8-week implementation timeline with realistic effort estimates

### Deliverables
- Complete Work Breakdown Structure with 47 work packages
- Resource allocation matrix with 4-developer team assignments
- Critical path analysis with dependency management
- Implementation schedule with milestone gates

### 3. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

#### **High-Risk Work Packages**
- **WP-F03 Constitutional AI Framework** (32h) - Complex AI safety implementation
  - **Risk:** AI constraint system may require additional research
  - **Mitigation:** 8h research buffer allocated, fallback to simpler rule-based system
  
- **WP-F07 Multi-Language Memory Coordination** (30h) - Cross-language complexity
  - **Risk:** Memory sharing between runtimes may have performance issues
  - **Mitigation:** Prototype early, fallback to message-passing architecture
  
- **WP-I03 Advanced LLM Infrastructure** (36h) - Performance and complexity risks
  - **Risk:** Reasoning chain assembly may exceed performance targets
  - **Mitigation:** Simplified reasoning fallback, performance monitoring from start

#### **Resource Contention Risks**
- **Week 2 Overlap:** Multiple packages requiring Developer A expertise
  - **Mitigation:** Pre-allocate 4h buffer in Developer C schedule for assistance
  
- **Week 4 Integration:** All developers needed for integration testing
  - **Mitigation:** Stagger individual package completion to allow focused integration

#### **Timeline Buffer Strategy**
- **Foundation Phase:** 12h buffer distributed across Weeks 1-2
- **Integration Phase:** 16h buffer in Week 3 for complex integration issues
- **Validation Phase:** 8h buffer in Week 5 for unexpected issues
- **Total Buffer:** 36h (5.6% of total 640h capacity)

## Next Steps: Day 23 Preparation

### Upcoming Focus: Mock & Stub Strategy
Day 23 will focus on:
- **Mock Implementation Design**: Create mock implementations for external dependencies
- **Test Harness Creation**: Design test harnesses for complex system interactions
- **Gradual Activation Planning**: Plan gradual real implementation activation strategy
- **Stub Service Architecture**: Design stub services for Phase 3 preparation

### Preparation Requirements
- Ensure Day 22 Work Breakdown Structure is validated and approved
- Confirm resource allocation and developer assignments
- Validate timeline and dependency management
- Prepare detailed work package specifications for Day 23 mock planning
