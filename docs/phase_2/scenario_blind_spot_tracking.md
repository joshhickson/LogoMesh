## 🎯 Critical Blind Spots for Additional Scenarios

Based on current coverage, these areas need dedicated scenarios:

1. **Enterprise Security & Compliance** - No scenarios test SOC2/HIPAA requirements
2. **Advanced AI Safety** - Missing bias detection, explainable AI testing  
3. **Developer Experience** - Plugin SDK, debugging tools not stress tested
4. **Privacy & Legal** - GDPR compliance, data deletion not covered
5. **Long-term Sustainability** - Archive management, performance degradation over time
