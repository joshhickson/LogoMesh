- Response time < 3 seconds for basic queries

### Task 5: Plugin System Foundation
**Goal:** Safe, sandboxed plugin execution

**Specific Actions:**
- [ ] Create plugin loading/unloading system
- [ ] Implement security sandbox
- [ ] Build plugin manifest validation
- [ ] Create example plugins

**Success Criteria:**
- Plugins can't crash main application
- Plugin permissions are enforced
- Easy to develop new plugins

### Task 6: Performance Optimization
**Goal:** Smooth operation under normal usage

**Specific Actions:**
- [ ] Profile and fix performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement intelligent caching
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add loading states for slow operations

**Success Criteria:**
- UI remains responsive during heavy operations
- Search results appear within 1 second
- No memory leaks during extended use

## Week 5-6: User Experience & Testing

### Task 7: Voice Integration
**Goal:** Text-to-speech for accessibility

**Specific Actions:**
- [ ] Implement cross-platform TTS
- [ ] Add voice controls for navigation
- [ ] Create audio feedback system
- [ ] Test on different devices

**Success Criteria:**
- TTS works on Windows, Mac, Linux
- Voice latency < 1 second
- Clear, understandable speech

### Task 8: Advanced Search
**Goal:** Find thoughts by meaning, not just keywords

**Specific Actions:**
- [ ] Implement local embedding generation
- [ ] Build semantic search interface
- [ ] Add search result ranking
- [ ] Create search suggestions

**Success Criteria:**
- Semantic search finds relevant results
- Search is faster than manual browsing
- Results improve over time

### Task 9: Comprehensive Testing
**Goal:** 90%+ test coverage, reliable CI/CD

**Specific Actions:**
- [ ] Write unit tests for all core functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests for AI features
- [ ] Implement automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Create manual testing checklist

**Success Criteria:**
- Test coverage above 90%
- All tests pass consistently
- New features require tests

### Task 10: Documentation & Developer Experience
**Goal:** New developers can contribute quickly

**Specific Actions:**
- [ ] Write clear setup instructions
- [ ] Document all APIs and interfaces
- [ ] Create plugin development guide
- [ ] Record video tutorials

**Success Criteria:**
- New developer setup time < 30 minutes
- All major features documented
- Plugin development is straightforward

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] <2 second response time for AI features
- [ ] Can handle 1000+ thoughts without performance issues
- [ ] <1% error rate in normal usage

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Users can complete common tasks without errors
- [ ] AI suggestions are helpful and transparent
- [ ] Search finds relevant results quickly
- [ ] Voice features work reliably
- [ ] No data loss during normal operations

### Developer Experience Metrics
- [ ] New developers can set up environment in <30 minutes
- [ ] Plugin development takes <2 hours for simple features
- [ ] All APIs are documented with examples
- [ ] Build process is reliable and fast

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **TypeScript Migration** - Could break existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Incremental conversion with testing at each step

2. **Performance with Large Datasets** - UI could become unresponsive
   - Mitigation: Implement progressive loading and caching

3. **Plugin Security** - Malicious plugins could compromise system
   - Mitigation: Strict sandboxing and permission system

4. **AI Integration Complexity** - Local LLM integration could be unreliable
   - Mitigation: Start with simple features, add robustness incrementally

### Contingency Plans
- If TypeScript migration fails: Continue with current JS but add strict linting
- If performance issues persist: Implement data virtualization
- If plugin system too complex: Defer to Phase 3, focus on core features
- If AI integration unreliable: Use mock responses until stability achieved

## Definition of Done

Phase 2 is complete when:
1. A new developer can set up and run LogoMesh in under 30 minutes
2. Users can create, organize, and search 100+ thoughts without issues
3. AI features provide helpful suggestions with full transparency
4. Plugins can be safely developed and deployed
5. All major features have comprehensive tests
6. Performance meets all specified benchmarks

This represents LogoMesh transformed from a prototype into a reliable platform ready for advanced AI features in Phase 3.
