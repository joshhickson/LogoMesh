- Complete documentation and Phase 3 readiness assessment

## Success Metrics (Weekly Gates)
- **Week 2:** All critical TypeScript errors resolved, basic audit trail working
- **Week 4:** Real-time processing demo working, plugin isolation functional
- **Week 6:** Security framework passes audit, multi-language plugins stable
- **Week 8:** All Phase 2 verification gates pass, Phase 3 contracts ready

## Dependency Mapping
```
TypeScript Migration → Plugin Isolation → Real-Time Processing
       ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   Audit Trail  →  VTC Foundation  →  Security Framework
       ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   DevShell Infrastructure → Integration Testing → Phase 3 Ready
```

## Risk Mitigation
- **If Week 2 gates fail:** Simplify plugin system, focus on basic isolation
- **If Week 4 gates fail:** Implement basic priority queues, defer advanced real-time features
- **If Week 6 gates fail:** Use simplified security model, focus on core functionality
