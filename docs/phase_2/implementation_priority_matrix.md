# Phase 2 Implementation Priority Matrix

## Critical Path Analysis (Top 5 Blockers)

### 1. **Real-Time Processing Architecture** (29 gaps, 7+ scenarios)
**Why Critical:** Blocks VR, multiplayer, TTS, and live analysis
**Implementation Order:**
- Deadline-aware TaskEngine (Week 3)
- Priority queue system (Week 3)
- Frame-rate resource allocation (Week 4)

### 2. **Plugin System Isolation** (35 gaps, all scenarios)
**Why Critical:** Foundation for everything else
**Implementation Order:**
- Crash detection and isolation (Week 1)
- Resource monitoring (Week 2)
- Multi-language sandboxing (Week 5)

### 3. **Vector Translation Core** (12 gaps, 8 scenarios)
**Why Critical:** Enables semantic intelligence
**Implementation Order:**
- Mock embedding pipeline (Week 1-2)
- Drift detection (Week 2)
- Universal translator interface (Week 2)

### 4. **Audit Trail Infrastructure** (21 gaps, all scenarios)
**Why Critical:** Required for debugging and compliance
**Implementation Order:**
- Basic audit logging (Week 1)
- Chain-of-thought capture (Week 5)
- Reasoning validation (Week 6)

### 5. **Security & Transparency Framework** (17 gaps, enterprise scenarios)
**Why Critical:** Enables production deployment
**Implementation Order:**
- Safety Mode controls (Week 1)
- Permission system (Week 5)
- Hardware security preparation (Week 6)

## Weekly Implementation Strategy

### Week 1-2: **Foundation Stabilization**
- Fix TypeScript errors
- Implement basic plugin isolation
- Create audit logging infrastructure
- Build VTC mock pipeline

### Week 3-4: **Core Engine Development**  
- Real-time TaskEngine with priority queues
- MeshGraphEngine algorithmic foundation
- Plugin resource monitoring
- Vector drift detection

### Week 5-6: **Advanced Systems**
- Multi-language plugin sandboxing
- DevShell security framework
- Chain-of-thought audit capture
- TTS cross-platform infrastructure

### Week 7-8: **Integration & Polish**
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completion
- Phase 3 readiness validation

## Success Metrics (Weekly Gates)
- **Week 2:** All critical TypeScript errors resolved, basic audit trail working
- **Week 4:** Real-time processing demo working, plugin isolation functional
- **Week 6:** Security framework passes audit, multi-language plugins stable
- **Week 8:** All Phase 2 verification gates pass, Phase 3 contracts ready

## Dependency Mapping
```
TypeScript Migration → Plugin Isolation → Real-Time Processing
       ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   Audit Trail  →  VTC Foundation  →  Security Framework
       ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   DevShell Infrastructure → Integration Testing → Phase 3 Ready
```

## Risk Mitigation
- **If Week 2 gates fail:** Simplify plugin system, focus on basic isolation
- **If Week 4 gates fail:** Implement basic priority queues, defer advanced real-time features
- **If Week 6 gates fail:** Use simplified security model, focus on core functionality
