This directory contains all documentation related to Phase 2 of the LogoMesh project. The structure is organized as follows:

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### `00_CURRENT_STATE/`
**Purpose:** Documents reflecting the actual implemented state of the project after Phase 1 and any subsequent minor updates. Phase 2 features will only appear here post-implementation.

### `01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN/` ‚≠ê **PRIMARY FOLDER**
**Purpose:** All documents related to the planning, specification, analysis, and roadmapping of Phase 2 features. **THIS IS THE PRIMARY FOLDER FOR UNDERSTANDING PHASE 2 PLANS.**

Contains detailed specifications, architectural diagrams, gap analyses, implementation roadmaps, and planning progress logs.

### `02_EXPLORATIONS_AND_IDEAS/`
**Purpose:** Hypothetical scenarios, brainstorming, and suggestions not yet part of the formal Phase 2 plan. Includes future explorations and experimental concepts.

### `ZZ_ARCHIVE/`
**Purpose:** Outdated or superseded planning documents retained for historical reference.

### `use_case_stress_tests/`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive scenario testing and stress case analyses for Phase 2 features.
