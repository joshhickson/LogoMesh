# Week 1 Gate Assessment

## Status: ⏳ IN PROGRESS - Task 1 Active

**Implementation Status**: Week 1, Task 1 in progress (enhanced with specification goals)  
**Gate Status**: Not yet assessed - pending task completion

This document tracks completion of Week 1 tasks and validates readiness for Week 2.

**Deadline**: End of Week 1
**Goal**: Plugin system foundation and TypeScript migration complete

## Completion Checklist

### Plugin System Foundation ✅
- [ ] **Multi-language plugin runtime working**
  - [ ] Node.js plugins load and execute
  - [ ] Python plugins load and execute
  - [ ] Resource isolation confirmed (memory/CPU limits)
  - [ ] Plugin lifecycle management (load/init/execute/cleanup)

- [ ] **Plugin security implemented**
  - [ ] Sandboxed execution environments
  - [ ] Manifest schema validation
  - [ ] Resource limit enforcement

### TypeScript Migration ✅
- [ ] **Zero compilation errors**
  - [ ] All core/ modules converted to TypeScript
  - [ ] All contracts/ modules fully typed
  - [ ] Frontend components converted to .tsx/.ts

- [ ] **Strict mode enabled**
  - [ ] `tsconfig.json` configured with strict: true
  - [ ] All type errors resolved
  - [ ] Import statements updated

## Testing Requirements

### Plugin System Tests
```bash
# These commands must pass:
npm test -- plugins
npm run test:integration -- plugin-runtime
```

### TypeScript Validation
```bash
# These commands must pass:
npm run build        # Zero TypeScript errors
npm run type-check   # All types valid
npm test            # All existing tests pass
```

## Demonstration Requirements

### Plugin Loading Demo
- Load sample Node.js plugin
- Load sample Python plugin
- Execute basic commands from each
- Show resource isolation working

### TypeScript Migration Demo
- Run full build process
- Show zero compilation errors
- Demonstrate type safety in IDE

## Gate Criteria

**PASS**: All checklist items complete, all tests passing, demonstrations successful
**FAIL**: Any checklist item incomplete OR any test failing

## If Gate Fails

1. **Identify blockers** - Which specific items are incomplete?
2. **Estimate fix time** - How long to resolve each blocker?
3. **Adjust timeline** - Should Week 2 be delayed or scope reduced?
4. **Document decisions** - Update implementation plan with changes

## Week 2 Prerequisites

Week 1 gate **must pass** before beginning:
- LLM integration (depends on TypeScript completion)
- Vector storage (depends on plugin system for embedding models)
- All Week 2 tasks assume Week 1 infrastructure is working
