# LogoMesh Phase 2 Development Plan - Infrastructure Foundations

**Version:** 2.1  
**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 complete with functional LM-Core, SQLite persistence, backend API, and basic AI integration stubs

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 focuses on building robust, testable infrastructure foundations for cognitive systems rather than activating full autonomy. This phase scaffolds the Vector Translation Core (VTC), prepares MeshGraphEngine interfaces, establishes comprehensive audit frameworks, and creates deterministic pipeline execution systems. All major systems will be implemented with local-first stubs and mock executors, creating the architectural foundation for Phase 3's real-time cognitive activation.
