## Risk Mitigation for Scope Management

### **If Timeline Pressure Increases**
1. **Defer Complex P1 Gaps:** Move 15 most complex P1 gaps to Phase 2.5
2. **Implement Simplified Versions:** Create minimal viable implementations for complex features
3. **Increase Mock Sophistication:** Use advanced mocks instead of full implementations for non-critical paths
4. **Parallel Development:** Split team into specialized tracks (security, plugins, performance, integration)

### **If Resource Constraints Occur**
1. **Focus on Critical Path Only:** Complete only gaps that block other implementations
2. **Implement Foundation Layers:** Build solid base for future enhancement rather than complete features
3. **Extensive Documentation:** Ensure incomplete gaps have detailed implementation plans for future completion
4. **Stakeholder Communication:** Clear communication about scope trade-offs and Phase 2.5 planning
