# LogoMesh Project Status - Phase 2

**Current Date:** January 2025  
**Project Phase:** Phase 2 Implementation Ready  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Planning Complete - Implementation Not Started

## üéØ What's Actually Happening

### Current Reality
- **Codebase Status:** Phase 1 Complete (React frontend + Express backend + SQLite)
- **Phase 2 Status:** Specifications complete, NO CODE IMPLEMENTATION yet
- **Active Plan:** [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - 4 weeks, 8 tasks
- **Progress:** Week 1 Task 1 enhanced with goals from specifications

### What Documents Matter Right Now
1. **[IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** - The actual plan being followed
2. **[week_1_gate_assessment.md](week_1_gate_assessment.md)** - Week 1 completion checklist
3. **[01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN/SPECIFICATIONS/](01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN/SPECIFICATIONS/)** - Reference specs

### What to Ignore
- **[ZZ_ARCHIVE/](ZZ_ARCHIVE/)** - Archived planning documents (for reference only)
- **[phase_2_revised_realistic.md](phase_2_revised_realistic.md)** - Alternative plan (not being used)
- **Multiple planning logs** - Planning phase is complete

## üîß Phase 2 Scope (Infrastructure Only)

**Building:** Plugin system, TypeScript migration, LLM integration, task engine, vector storage  
**NOT Building:** Advanced AI features, multi-agent coordination, complex reasoning  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks total  
**Current Week:** Week 1 (Task 1 in progress)

## üìã Implementation Progress

### Week 1: Plugin System Foundation
- **Task 1:** Multi-Language Plugin Runtime ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS (enhanced with specification goals)
- **Task 2:** TypeScript Migration Core Systems ‚è≠Ô∏è PENDING

### Week 2: LLM Infrastructure & Storage  
- **Task 3:** Local LLM Integration (Ollama) ‚è≠Ô∏è PENDING
- **Task 4:** Enhanced SQLite with Embeddings Support ‚è≠Ô∏è PENDING

### Week 3: Task Engine & DevShell
- **Task 5:** Task Engine Workflow System ‚è≠Ô∏è PENDING
- **Task 6:** DevShell Command Interface ‚è≠Ô∏è PENDING

### Week 4: Integration & Testing
- **Task 7:** Complete Test Coverage ‚è≠Ô∏è PENDING
- **Task 8:** Documentation & Developer Experience ‚è≠Ô∏è PENDING

## üéØ For New AI Agents

**Start Here:** Read this document first  
**Then:** Review [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)  
**Context:** Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 planning is complete, implementation is starting  
**Goal:** Build working infrastructure that Phase 3 can activate

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Points

- Phase 2 builds **infrastructure only** - no advanced AI features
- All extensive documentation in specifications is for **reference** during implementation
- Current focus is **Week 1, Task 1** - Multi-Language Plugin Runtime
- Success metric: **Working infrastructure** that can load plugins and execute basic workflows
