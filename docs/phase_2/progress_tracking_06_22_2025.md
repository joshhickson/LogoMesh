# Phase 2 Implementation Plan Enhancement Progress
**Date:** June 22, 2025  
**Mission:** Systematically enhance the 8-week implementation plan using existing Phase 2 specifications

## Original Mission Statement
Execute the existing Phase 2 enhancement strategy by systematically adding Enhanced/Stretch goals from Core Specifications to the 8-week implementation plan, while maintaining the proven Core/Enhanced/Stretch categorization that worked for Task 1.

## Approach Confirmed
- âœ… Use existing Implementation Priority Matrix as master reference
- âœ… Pull specific goals from Core Specifications document  
- âœ… Continue pattern from Task 1 (Core/Enhanced/Stretch structure)
- âœ… Reference extensive planning documentation already completed
- âœ… Work week-by-week with reality checks against actual codebase

## Progress Checklist

### Week 1 Tasks
- [x] **Task 1: Plugin System Foundation** - âœ… COMPLETED (enhanced)
- [x] **Task 2: TypeScript Migration** - âœ… COMPLETED (enhanced) 
- [x] **Task 3: DevShell Implementation** - âœ… COMPLETED (enhanced)
- [ðŸŽ¯] **Task 4: Basic Task Engine** - ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (realistic approach using existing LLMTaskRunner/LLMOrchestrator)

### Week 2 Tasks  
- [ ] **Task 5: LLM Integration Infrastructure** - Pending
- [ ] **Task 6: Storage Layer Enhancement** - Pending
- [ ] **Task 7: Security Framework** - Pending
- [ ] **Task 8: Integration & Testing** - Pending

### Documentation Tasks
- [ ] Create reference appendix mapping specifications to enhancements
- [ ] Validate all enhancements against actual codebase structure
- [ ] Ensure no hallucination of non-existent systems/APIs

## Reality Check Constraints
- Only reference actual files in `/core/`, `/contracts/`, `/src/` directories
- Only reference real interfaces like `LLMExecutor`, `StorageAdapter` 
- Ground all enhancements in existing Core Specifications document
- Validate each week before proceeding to next

## Success Criteria
- All 8 tasks enhanced with actionable goals from existing specifications
- Clear traceability between documentation and implementation plan
- Preserved clean structure that made Task 1 successful
- No invented systems or hallucinated APIs
