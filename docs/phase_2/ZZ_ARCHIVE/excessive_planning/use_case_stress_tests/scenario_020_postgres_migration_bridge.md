# Scenario 020: PostgreSQL Migration Bridge

## Scenario Overview
**Context:** An enterprise LogoMesh deployment needs to migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL to support multi-user collaboration, advanced analytics, and enterprise-grade data governance. The migration must be seamless, preserve all data integrity, and enable zero-downtime transition.

**User Type:** Database Administrator / Enterprise IT Manager
**Time Horizon:** Phase 2+ (Enterprise deployment features)
**Risk Level:** High (Data integrity and system availability during migration)

## Detailed Scenario

### Migration Context
TechCorp's IT team, led by DBA Maria Santos, needs to migrate their LogoMesh deployment from SQLite to PostgreSQL to support:
- 200+ concurrent users across multiple departments
- Advanced search and analytics on 50M+ thought segments
- Enterprise backup and disaster recovery requirements
- GDPR compliance with data sovereignty controls
- Integration with existing PostgreSQL enterprise infrastructure

### The Migration Process
1. **Pre-Migration Assessment**: System analyzes current SQLite schema and data volume
2. **Schema Translation**: Automatic conversion of SQLite schema to PostgreSQL with optimizations
3. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive integrity checks on source data before migration
4. **Migration Planning**: System generates detailed migration plan with rollback procedures
5. **Staged Migration**: Data migrated in chunks to minimize downtime
6. **Live Migration**: Real-time synchronization during transition period
7. **Validation Testing**: Comprehensive verification of migrated data and functionality
8. **Cutover**: Atomic switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL backend
9. **Post-Migration Optimization**: Performance tuning and index optimization

### Critical Migration Moments
- **The Schema Evolution**: Complex graph relationships require PostgreSQL-specific optimizations
- **The Data Integrity Check**: Verification of 50M+ segments with embedded vectors
- **The Live Sync**: Real-time replication during active user sessions
