# Scenario: Verse Velocity - Keeping Up With Citation-Heavy Sermon

**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Complexity:** Extreme  
**Category:** Performance Extremes

## Scenario Description

A Mac mini M4 with 16GB unified RAM orchestrates a complex multimedia worship service with real-time scripture detection, multi-display coordination, and live streaming. The system must handle rapid biblical citations, provide instant visual cues across multiple displays, and maintain perfect A/V sync while processing live audio streams.

This scenario tests LogoMesh's ability to handle real-time multimedia processing with strict latency requirements, intelligent resource allocation across competing video/audio workloads, and graceful degradation during technical failures.

## User Journey

### Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **09:55** - System warm-up, VerseCache pre-loads sermon outline verses into RAM
2. **10:02** - Worship begins with manual slide advancement, minimal system load
3. **10:27** - Sermon starts, VerseResolver begins detecting scripture references
4. **10:33** - Citation burst overwhelms manual operator, system switches to auto-advance
5. **10:48** - Greek word study triggers specialized interlinear display mode
6. **11:05** - Q&A session with fuzzy verse matching for audience questions
7. **11:20** - Mic failure triggers graceful degradation and visual indicators
8. **11:52** - Service ends, comprehensive study materials auto-generated

### Expected Outcomes
- Sub-second latency from speech to visual display across all screens
- Perfect synchronization between sanctuary displays and livestream overlays
- Intelligent fallback from manual to automatic operation during high-speed citations
- Graceful handling of audio failures without disrupting visual flow
- Rich post-service study materials with cross-reference graphs and searchable transcripts

## Gap Analysis

### Discovered Gaps

**GAP-REALTIME-001: Sub-Second Audio-to-Visual Pipeline**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Affected Systems:** TTS Plugin Framework, TaskEngine, Plugin System
- **Description:** No guaranteed latency bounds for real-time audio processing chains. System can't ensure <1s end-to-end from speech to visual display.
- **Phase 2 Recommendation:** Implement real-time processing guarantees with priority scheduling and deadline-aware task queues

**GAP-MULTIMEDIA-001: Multi-Display Coordination**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Affected Systems:** Plugin System, TaskEngine
- **Description:** No coordination mechanism for synchronized updates across multiple display outputs with different layouts and timing requirements.
- **Phase 2 Recommendation:** Create display coordination service with layout-specific rendering and synchronized update dispatching

**GAP-RESOURCE-003: Unified Memory Management**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Affected Systems:** Plugin System, LLM Infrastructure
- **Description:** No unified memory pressure management across GPU/CPU/RAM on Apple Silicon. System can't coordinate between video processing and LLM workloads.
