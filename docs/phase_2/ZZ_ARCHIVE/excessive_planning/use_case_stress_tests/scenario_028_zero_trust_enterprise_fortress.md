  private classificationEngine: SecurityClassificationEngine;

  async authenticateAndAuthorize(request: SecureRequest): Promise<AuthResult> {

      throw new SecurityThreatDetectedException();
    }
    
    return { identity, clearance, threatScore };
  }
}

## Architecture Philosophy

### Security Through Mathematical Proof, Not Hope
Enterprise security must be based on cryptographic guarantees and mathematical proofs, not assumptions about attacker capabilities or good intentions.

### Zero Trust Means Zero Exceptions
Every request, every user, every device must be continuously verified with hardware-backed cryptographic proof - no exceptions for convenience or legacy systems.

### Automated Response Faster Than Human Reaction
Threats move at machine speed, so responses must be automated and faster than any human could react, with complete forensic evidence preservation.

**Analysis Status:** COMPLETE  
**Next Actions:** Integrate zero-trust architecture into Phase 2 security framework, implement hardware-backed authentication
