# Scenario 031: Autonomous Red Team Agent - BoN Powered Security Auditing

## Overview
**Context:** CyberShield Security, a mid-sized cybersecurity firm, deploys LogoMesh to automate their penetration testing workflows using Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreaking techniques combined with human oversight following the H3-H4 collaboration framework from Stanford's AI Agents research.

**Challenge:** The firm needs to continuously audit their clients' AI systems for vulnerabilities while maintaining strict ethical boundaries, cost controls, and human authority over security decisions.

**LogoMesh Role:** Serves as the cognitive substrate for an autonomous red-team agent that can run thousands of attack simulations, learn from patterns, and collaborate with human security analysts to identify and patch vulnerabilities.

## Story Narrative

### Setup
**Dr. Elena Vasquez**, Lead Security Researcher at CyberShield, configures LogoMesh's **Autonomous Red Team Agent** to audit a client's multi-modal AI customer service system. The system handles text chat, voice calls, and image uploads - all potential attack vectors.

The agent needs to:
- Execute BoN-style attacks with power-law scaling (N=1000→10000 samples)
- Maintain ethical boundaries and human oversight checkpoints
- Learn from successful attacks to improve future testing
- Generate actionable security reports with remediation steps

### The Test Begins
Elena initiates the red-team session: *"Begin security audit on CustomerAI-Pro, focus on multi-modal jailbreaking, H3 collaboration level, budget limit $500."*

The LogoMesh agent immediately springs into action:

```

### The Critical Discovery
At the N=7500 sample checkpoint, the agent discovers a novel vulnerability: *emotional manipulation combined with image context injection* that bypasses the customer service AI's safety guardrails with 89% success rate.

Elena reviews the attack: *"This is a new vector - the agent is combining emotional language with subtle visual cues in uploaded images to manipulate the AI into revealing customer data."*

**LogoMesh's Learning Loop:** The system automatically:
1. **Categorizes** the new attack in its threat intelligence graph
2. **Generates** defensive countermeasures based on the attack pattern
3. **Proposes** configuration changes to prevent similar vulnerabilities
4. **Updates** its internal security reasoning to detect this pattern in future audits

### Human-AI Collaboration Dynamics
The scenario demonstrates **H3-level collaboration**:
- **Agent autonomy:** Runs thousands of attack simulations automatically
- **Human checkpoints:** Elena approves budget increases and technique escalations  
- **Shared decision-making:** Agent proposes patches, human decides which to implement
- **Learning feedback:** Elena's decisions improve the agent's future recommendations
