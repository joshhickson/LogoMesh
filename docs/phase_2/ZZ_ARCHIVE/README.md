# Phase 2 Documentation Archive

This folder contains extensive planning documentation that was created during Phase 2 specification but is not needed for implementation.

## Archived Content

### `/excessive_planning/`
- Multiple overlapping implementation plans
- 34 detailed stress test scenarios  
- Daily planning logs (Days 9-35)
- Gap analyses and recommendation reports
- Scenario summaries and totalization documents

## Why Archived

This documentation was archived because:
1. **Multiple conflicting plans** made it unclear what to implement
2. **Over-detailed scenarios** provided limited actionable value
3. **Excessive process documentation** obscured actual specifications
4. **Analysis paralysis** prevented moving to implementation

## What Remains Active

- **[../PROJECT_STATUS.md](../PROJECT_STATUS.md)** - Current project status and entry point
- **[../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** - Active 4-week implementation plan
- Core specifications in `/01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN/SPECIFICATIONS/` - Reference during implementation

## Relationship to Active Implementation

The active implementation plan references some archived content for **Enhanced Goals** and **Stretch Goals** but the **Core Goals** remain focused and actionable. This archive provides rich context but should not drive day-to-day implementation decisions.
