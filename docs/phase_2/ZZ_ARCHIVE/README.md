# Phase 2 Documentation Archive

This folder contains extensive planning documentation that was created during Phase 2 specification but is not needed for implementation.

## Archived Content

### `/excessive_planning/`
- Multiple overlapping implementation plans
- 34 detailed stress test scenarios  
- Daily planning logs (Days 9-35)
- Gap analyses and recommendation reports
- Scenario summaries and totalization documents

## Why Archived

This documentation was archived because:
1. **Multiple conflicting plans** made it unclear what to implement
2. **Over-detailed scenarios** provided limited actionable value
3. **Excessive process documentation** obscured actual specifications
4. **Analysis paralysis** prevented moving to implementation

## What Remains Active

- Core specifications in `/01_PLANNING_AND_DESIGN/SPECIFICATIONS/`
- Single implementation plan: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Realistic 4-week plan: `phase_2_revised_realistic.md`

The active documentation focuses on **what to build** rather than **how we planned it**.
