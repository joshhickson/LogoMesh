# Phase 2 Implementation Plan

**Status**: Ready for implementation  
**Goal**: Build working infrastructure foundations that Phase 3 can activate

## What Phase 2 Actually Delivers

### Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- **Plugin System**: Load and execute plugins safely
- **TypeScript Migration**: Complete conversion from JS
- **Storage Layer**: Enhanced SQLite with embedding support
- **Basic Security**: User settings and safety controls

### AI Integration (Week 3-4)  
- **LLM Infrastructure**: Local model integration (Ollama)
- **Task Engine**: Basic workflow execution
- **Audit System**: Track all AI interactions
- **DevShell**: Safe development command interface

### Validation (Week 4)
- **Testing**: 90%+ coverage with working CI
- **Documentation**: Developer setup <30 minutes
- **Performance**: Handles 100+ thoughts smoothly
- **Integration**: All systems work together

## Success Criteria

**Technical Requirements:**
- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Plugin system loads Node.js and Python plugins
- [ ] LLM integration works with 2+ models
- [ ] All interactions logged and auditable
- [ ] <500ms response time for typical operations

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] New developer setup <30 minutes
- [ ] No crashes during normal usage
- [ ] Clear interfaces for Phase 3 activation

## What's Deferred to Phase 3

- Real-time AI decision making
- Advanced semantic analysis  
- Multi-agent coordination
- Complex reasoning chains
- Enterprise-grade features

This focuses on **building working infrastructure** rather than comprehensive planning.
