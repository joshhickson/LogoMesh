# PHASE 2 ADDENDUM: DevShell & Cognitive Development Mode

**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

**Prerequisite:** Phase 1 foundation complete, including `PluginHost`, `TaskEngine`, `LLMExecutor`, `LLMTaskRunner`, `ContextStateService`, and stubs for `DevShell`, `CodeAnalysisLLMExecutor`, and `Pipeline` schema. Plugin interface contracts and EventBus must be active.

**Overall Goal for this Addendum:**  
To implement the DevShell subsystem as an internal cognitive development console. DevShell provides a plugin-based interface for live introspection, code and config editing, LLM-augmented development tools, and the creation of intelligent pipelines from natural language. It is the primary access point for self-directed expansion and debugging of LogoMesh.

## Theme 1: DevShell Plugin Foundation

### Sub-Theme 1.1: Manifest & Registration

- **Concept:** Register DevShell as a privileged plugin with developer-only access.
    
- **Modules/Features:**
    
    1. `@plugins/devshell/devShellPlugin.ts`
        
    2. Plugin manifest:
        
        ```json
        {
          "id": "devshell",
          "name": "Developer Shell",
          "capabilities": ["canAccessFilesystem", "canUseLLM"],
          "restricted": true
        }
        ```
        
    3. Hook into EventBus: `devshell/input`, `devshell/prompt`, `devshell/taskSubmitted`
        
- **Verification:** Plugin loads, routes developer requests, and exposes input surface.

### Sub-Theme 1.2: CloudDevLLMExecutor & Developer Mode

- **Concept:** Let DevShell send dev prompts to a designated high-context external model.
    
- **Modules/Features:**
    
    - `CloudDevLLMExecutor`:
        
        ```ts
        interface CloudDevLLMExecutor extends LLMExecutor {
          apiKey: string;
          contextWindow: number;
        }
        ```
        
    - Config toggle: `[TOGGLE_DEVELOPER_MODE]`
        
    - Failover: revert to local model if API key missing
        
- **Verification:** DevShell calls return structured completions from external LLM.

## Theme 2: Cognitive Tooling & Prompt Interfaces

### Sub-Theme 2.1: CodeAnalysisLLMExecutor

- **Concept:** Let DevShell reflect on code snippets, plugin manifests, or TS types.
    
- **Modules/Features:**
    
    - Accept code string or file reference
        
    - Analyze for:
        
        - Compliance with `PluginAPI`
            
        - Errors or improvement suggestions
            
        - Suggested field defaults or config schema
            
- **Verification:** DevShell returns readable diagnostic and rewrite suggestion per snippet.

### Sub-Theme 2.2: Natural-Language Pipeline Builder

- **Concept:** User writes a prompt like "Create a pipeline that summarizes 5 recent thoughts and reads them aloud."
    
- **Modules/Features:**
    
    - Prompt passed to `LLMTaskRunner` with `taskType: "pipeline-draft"`
        
    - Model returns JSON conforming to `Pipeline` type
        
    - User can approve or edit pipeline before submission
        
- **Verification:** Drafted pipelines can be saved, run, or edited via UI/API.

## Theme 3: Filesystem Access & Controlled Mutation

### Sub-Theme 3.1: Plugin-Safe Read/Write Access

- **Concept:** Allow read-only or proposed edits to file system, under review.
    
- **Modules/Features:**
    
    - `PluginAPI.readFile(path: string): string`
        
    - `PluginAPI.proposeFileChange(path: string, newContent: string)`
        
    - UI/CLI confirmation step before applying
        
- **Verification:** Proposals are logged, confirmable, and traceable in audit log.

## Theme 4: Interface Layer & Access Control

### Sub-Theme 4.1: Embedded DevShell Terminal

- **Concept:** Provide a CLI-style terminal inside the UI, scoped to DevShell context.
    
- **Modules/Features:**
    
    - `DevShellTerminal.tsx`: accepts text prompts, returns model output or command results
        
    - UI routes: `/devshell`, toggle from settings
        
    - Keyboard nav, history, export logs
        
- **Verification:** Terminal runs in dev mode only and executes expected tasks or LLM queries.

## Theme 5: Self-Refinement Utilities

### Sub-Theme 5.1: Self-Debugging Agent Mode

- **Concept:** DevShell asks itself why a plugin or pipeline failed.
    
- **Modules/Features:**
    
    - Prompt: “Analyze why pipeline XYZ failed” → looks at audit logs, task outputs, errors
        
    - Output: explanation, confidence level, and fix suggestion
        
- **Verification:** User can walk through root cause analysis using DevShell autonomously.

## Implications for Phase 2 Timeline & Scope

- DevShell transforms LogoMesh from a reactive system into a **co-developer**
    
- Key for intelligent plugin validation, task planning, and interactive experimentation
    
- Foundation for Phase 3: **Autonomous Cognitive Development**, **Plugin Bootstrapping**, and **Real-Time Debugging Assistants**

**This addendum is how LogoMesh becomes self-extending.** Without it, every evolution is manual. With it, cognition starts to write itself.
