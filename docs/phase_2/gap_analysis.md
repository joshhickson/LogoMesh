# Phase 2 Gap Analysis Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Purpose:** Systematic tracking of gaps, holes, and improvements needed for Phase 2 infrastructure

## Framework Overview

This document tracks gaps discovered through creative use case testing. Each gap is classified, prioritized, and mapped to specific Phase 2 systems to ensure comprehensive coverage and efficient resolution.

## Gap Classification System

### Gap Types
- **ARCHITECTURAL** - Missing fundamental system capability or design flaw
- **SECURITY** - Insufficient sandboxing, permission model, or safety controls
- **INTEGRATION** - Poor communication between systems or missing interfaces
- **PERFORMANCE** - Scalability, resource management, or timing issues
- **UI/UX** - Missing developer/user interface components or poor usability
- **TESTING** - Inadequate mock behavior or missing test scenarios
- **DOCUMENTATION** - Missing specifications or unclear system behavior

### Priority Levels
- **P0-CRITICAL** - Blocks Phase 2 foundation, must fix before any Phase 3 work
- **P1-HIGH** - Significantly impacts system reliability or developer experience
- **P2-MEDIUM** - Quality-of-life improvement or edge case handling
- **P3-LOW** - Nice-to-have enhancement or future consideration

### Impact Scope
- **ISOLATED** - Affects single system/component
- **SYSTEM** - Affects multiple related components
- **CROSS-CUTTING** - Affects multiple unrelated systems
- **FOUNDATIONAL** - Affects core architecture or contracts
