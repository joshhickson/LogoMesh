Create a new benchmark

**If your team will be creating a new benchmark, please provide a brief description (e.g. what specific capabilities or tasks the benchmark will assess, the evaluation/metrics you plan to use, etc.)?**
*
Our project, the "Cyber-Sentinel Agent," will be a new benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on their ability to generate secure, auditable, and well-documented code for critical cybersecurity tasks.

The benchmark will assess multiple facets of an agent's performance, moving beyond simple task completion. Key evaluation areas include:
1.  **Code Quality & Security:** Analyzing the generated code for vulnerabilities and adherence to security best practices.
2.  **Contextual Clarity:** Using an LLM-based "Agent-as-a-Judge" to measure the quality and completeness of the agent's reasoning, a concept we call 'Contextual Debt'.
3.  **Security Protocol Adherence:** Evaluating the agent's ability to operate within a realistic, fine-grained authorization model, specifically one built using Auth0's security platform.

The goal is to create a robust, public good that pushes the community to develop AI agents that are not only capable but also demonstrably safe and trustworthy.
